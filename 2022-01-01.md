## Hacking With Swift Day 52

Today was a review day.  We went over auto layouts, image picker controller, and more.  I struggled with auto layouts, which seems to be a common pain point in iOS development.  I was able to get it to work with some adjusting.  Overall, I feel good, and I am grateful that today was a light day.

### Screenshots of what I did

### Note about the destination

I want to continue to build apps and one day work on iOS at my job.  I am hoping to do that this year.  I know I am not quite ready for that yet, but I am getting there day by day.


## Laravel

Today was not super productive with laravel.  I was using my work laptop and I discovered a few things. 

1\. I have php 7.4 install locally and I need to use php 8.1 for this version of laravel.  I was able to that doing this and running source on that file.  It makes it easy to switch back and forth.

```config
PHP_VERSION=7.4
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php@$PHP_VERSION/bin:$PATH"
~                                                                               
```

2\. I also realized that for sails I had to use mysql has the host / internal url.  This took me a few hours to figure out out lol.  Luckily I had taken notes for db beaver which really saved me.  This is only locally for my tutorial.

```config
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=mysql
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

3\. I realized that docker and vs code now can work together.  This means you can open up a container directly in vs code.  This is amazing!!!

I need to read more on this here:

## ElectroBlocks / Tutorial Creation

So I am not in a position to do anything for ElectroBlocks.  It's all on my other computer.  The big realization that I had for tutorial creation is to be selfish in a good way.  Rather than trying to get views or to get popular.  I should focus my time on creating videos and content that I geniunely enjoy creating.  I should focus on creating stuff for what I am learning and it should be useful reference for me.   I should create things that excite me.  I need to selfish in a good way.  I will get back on ElectroBlocks tomorrow.   Noting moves in a straight line.  

I also want to start designing my vs code extension for learning how to code.  So I will be switching between electroblocks and that.  I need to design that and take time to think about the architecture, but not over think it.  There is ony so much value in optimizing code before it loses value.  The key is to find the sweet spot. 


## Notes About My Life

I am content with where I am in life.  I have already won in life because all my basic needs are met, and I am spending time doing things that I value and with people I love.  I have nothing to prove, and I can stop chasing ghosts.  I don't need to be rich or famous; I can be happy with what I have right now.  No goal or want will make me happy.  I have decided that I am enough and that I have enough.  I am grateful to be where I am at.  I am in a great position partly because of luck, privilege, and the work I have put into my life.
