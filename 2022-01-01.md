## Hacking With Swift Day 52

Today was a review day.  We went over auto layouts, image picker controller, and more.  I struggled with auto layouts, which seems to be a common pain point in iOS development.  I was able to get it to work with some adjusting.  Overall, I feel good, and I am grateful that today was a light day.

### Note about the destination

I want to continue to build apps and one day work on iOS at my job.  I am hoping to do that this year.  I know I am not quite ready for that yet, but I am getting there day by day.















## Notes About My Life

I am content with where I am in life.  I have already won in life because all my basic needs are met, and I am spending time doing things that I value.  I have nothing to prove, and I can stop chasing ghosts.  I don't need to be rich or famous; I can be happy with what I have right now.  No goal or want will make me happy.  I have decided that I am enough and that I have enough.  I am grateful to be where I am at.  I am in a great position partly because of luck, privilege, and my work into my life.
