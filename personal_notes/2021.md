# Personal Notes 2021

## 2021-12-30

I don't do well with criticism.  I need to work on that.  I take it as way too seriously and I chew on it for way too long.  The truth is that adults are going to disagree when I ideas are presented to them.  It's ok be disagree and that's actually a good thing.  I should be tolerant and accepting of other people's ideas but also be willing to have my own ideas as well.  It's all a balance.

Having admited that I also need to be willing to leave a space or not look at something for a few days.  Whatever it takes to not over analyze a situation.  It's important to move forward and not backwards.  In other words keep what I like and leave the rest.
