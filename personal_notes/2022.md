# Personal Notes - 2022

## 2022-01-01

I am content with where I am in life.  I have already won in life because all my basic needs are met, and I am spending time doing things that I value and with people I love.  I have nothing to prove, and I can stop chasing ghosts.  I don't need to be rich or famous; I can be happy with what I have right now.  No goal or want will make me happy.  I have decided that I am enough and that I have enough.  I am grateful to be where I am at.  I am in a great position partly because of luck, privilege, and the work I have put into my life.

I was able to get a lot of stuff done towards the end of the day.  I spent a lot of time with my partner.  It's important to have balance.  I am grateful that I got done with what I got done.

My boss quit the job today.  I was not happy about it, but I was happy for him.  He made the best decision I feel for his family and his life.  I know I am going to have to pick up the slack.  This will mean learning Laravel at a much deeper level and learning PostGIS.  I bought PostGIS in action.  

Bottom line is that I need to study in morning and divide and conquer.  He was such a core part of the team that we will need to divide up the work.  I will also be getting advice from my mentors.  It's important to keep a cool head and move forward.

Today I was still sad about the job and losing my boss.  I am feeling better about the situation overall.  I know it's going to be rough.  I know I will need community and reach out to people in my network.  Thankfully I have quite a few friends, a supporting partner, and good co-workers.  I know everything will be okay and that my job is to be honest, and empathetic.  Empathy is the most underrated skill in writing code.

I need to make more time during the day to study.  I am seeing how productive I am with this blog, making me feel a lot better about myself.  I want to say that none of this makes me complete.  Last year, the biggest lesson I learned from my boyfriend was that I have already won at life.  There is nothing left to prove, and everything is just icing on the cake from this point forward.  I am grateful that I am in this position, and I realize that a lot of luck, privilege, and work got me here.  I am thankful that I am enjoying my life and laughing, even if I am laughing at myself!

Changes are happening at work because my boss has quit.  It looks like we are going to have to hire two people.  My boss is a good man, and I am happy that he found a place to have more of what he wants in life!.  I feel that everything will get back to a standard space soon; I just have to be ok with some cautious.

Today I made my partner feel stupid.  I was so wrong to do that and to say what I said.  One of the most damning things you can do in any relationship is make the other person feel small.  I am committed to gaining deeper levels of empathy towards others.  I know I have a lot of work to do in that department.  I will never be perfect, and I can always get better.  

## 2022-01-09

I am happy with the way things are going.  I know I need to let go of things I can not change.  I felt a little trapped by worry and anxiety.  I also know I need to cut back.  One of my big goals is not to strive for perfection.  It's about progress and not being perfect!  I know change is unavoidable.  Things to that help me recognize that everything is going great.

1\. I have already won in life. This has been made painfully clear to me. I don't have anything left to prove. I am good enough, and everything and everyone around me is too!

2\. I need to be realistic.  The reality is that I am not going to be famous.  I need to accept reality and let go of fantasy and delusional thinking.  It's ok to say I will not make millions or billions of dollars.  It's ok to give up on ridiculous ego-driven dreams.    

3\. It was not my expectations that were holding me back but my unrealistic expectations.  

4\.  I am going to drop balls, and I will fail at specific tasks.  I will not set goals or try to put timelines on my life.  Instead, I will show up consistently and let time, God, and the universe care of the rest.

5\. I need to be of service to others.  I need to take a genuine interest in other people's lives and help other people.  This means caring about what they think and asking them about themselves.  I need to be of service to my community without unrealistic expectations around the service.  I need to stop trying to save the world and just be a part of it.  Worker among workers.
