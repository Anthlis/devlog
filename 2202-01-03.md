## PostGIS In Action

Today I learned about PostGIS and some of its competitors.  I was surprised to learn that Microsoft SQL supports geolocation queries.  

### Question Spatial SQL database can answer.

The biggest thing that got reinforced was the types of questions a geospatial database can answer.  
What it allows us to do is combine location data with SQL data.


### Questions

- If an airport is put in location x home, many homes within a 5-mile radius will be affected?
- How many customers that make over 20,000 dollars live within a 20-mile radius?
