## Hacking With Swift Day 50

Today I was a challenge day where I had to practice everything that I learned.   While this looks easy it took me about 2 hours to do.  I know in the future this app would take about 20 minutes.  I know that if I was just learning how to code it would have taken all day.  Everything takes time! :)

[code](https://github.com/phptuts/100DaysOfSwift/tree/master/Challenge50TableViewPictures/Challenge50TableViewPictures) is here.

Most of the action happens in the [view controller](https://github.com/phptuts/100DaysOfSwift/blob/master/Challenge50TableViewPictures/Challenge50TableViewPictures/ViewController.swift).

### Navigating between tableview controller and view controller

I reviewed how to navigate between a tableview controller to a detailed view controller.  Because the detailed view controller has a custom property I need to pass that along before I navigated to the view controller.

```swift
override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
        if let vc = self.storyboard?.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "DetailView") as? DetailViewController {
            vc.photo = photos[indexPath.row]
            navigationController?.pushViewController(vc, animated: true)
        }
    }
```

### Create a custom a custom table cell view

Note besure you connect this to the storyboard.

```swift
// view controller
override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
        guard let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "picture") as? PictureCell else {
            fatalError("Error Dequeuing Cell")
        }
        cell.pictureImage.image = UIImage(contentsOfFile: photos[indexPath.row].filePath)
        cell.pictureName.text = photos[indexPath.row].name
        return cell

    }

import UIKit

class PictureCell: UITableViewCell {

    @IBOutlet var pictureName: UILabel!
    @IBOutlet var pictureImage: UIImageView!
    override func awakeFromNib() {
        super.awakeFromNib()
        // Initialization code
    }

    override func setSelected(_ selected: Bool, animated: Bool) {
        super.setSelected(selected, animated: animated)

        // Configure the view for the selected state
    }

}

```
### UI Image Picker Controller 

I had to remember to set it to user the view controller as it's delegate.  This mean implementing the imagePickerController func is ran after the user selects an image.  Notice edit is set to true, this allows user to set the image.

```swift
@objc func addPhoto() {
        let picker = UIImagePickerController()
        if UIImagePickerController.isSourceTypeAvailable(.camera) {
            picker.sourceType = .camera
        }
        // This must be allowed for selecting images
        picker.allowsEditing = true
        picker.delegate = self
        present(picker, animated: true)
    }
    
    func imagePickerController(_ picker: UIImagePickerController, didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo info: [UIImagePickerController.InfoKey : Any]) {
        guard let image = info[.editedImage] as? UIImage else { return }
        
        let name = UUID().uuidString
        let path = getDocumentDirectory().appendingPathComponent(name)
        
        // Dismiss the image picker
        dismiss(animated: true)
        
        let ac = UIAlertController(title: "Name Picture", message: nil, preferredStyle: .alert)
        ac.addTextField()
        ac.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Add", style: .default) {
            [weak self, weak ac] _ in
            guard let text = ac?.textFields?.first?.text else { return }
            if let jpegData = image.jpegData(compressionQuality: 0.75) {
                try? jpegData.write(to: path)
            }
            let photo = Photo(name: text, filePath: path.path)
            self?.photos.insert(photo, at: 0)
            self?.tableView.insertRows(at: [IndexPath(row: 0, section: 0)], with: .automatic)
            self?.savePhotos()
        })
        present(ac, animated: true)
    }
    
    func getDocumentDirectory() -> URL {
        let paths = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)
        return paths[0]
    }

```

### Saving the user defaults

I map everything to Codable Photo Struct

```swift
import Foundation


struct Photo: Codable {
    var name: String
    var filePath: String
}

```

The important thing to remember is that when you are saving user defaults to JSON encode and decode.  

```swift

// Encode
func savePhotos() {
        let encoder = JSONEncoder()
        if let encodedPics = try? encoder.encode(self.photos) {
            let defaults = UserDefaults.standard
            defaults.set(encodedPics, forKey: "photos")
        }
    }
    
// Decode
// done in the viewDidLoad
let defaults = UserDefaults.standard
        
        if let data = defaults.object(forKey: "photos") as? Data {
            let decoder = JSONDecoder()
            do {
                photos = try decoder.decode([Photo].self, from: data)
            } catch {
                print("Could not decode")
            }
        }
```


## Laravel

Today I in the Udemy course I learned how to create controller routes.  I did learn that you can create a single controller route.  I also learned more about laravel sails.  I can't publish the repo because of my job for now.

I also learned more about laravel sails.

### DB Beaver Setup with Laravel Sails

Setup is really easy with db beaver.  I need to go to driver properties.  

I had to set **allowPublicKeyRetrieval** to **true** and **useSSL** to **false**.

![Screen Shot 2021-12-30 at 3 17 46 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9620015/147793890-327fa0d2-251d-4f20-8fe4-8d705f14ce3d.png)

I was also able to setup on mac an alias for sails by creating a ~/.zshrc file.

### Sails alias

1\. Run the command to create or edit the .zshrc
```bash
vi ~/.zshrc
```

2\. Copy this into the file

```
alias sail="bash ./vendor/bin/sail"
```

3\. Source the file

```
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Sails info

Every time you want to use artisan put sail in front of it.

```bash
sail artisan migrate
```

To start up the container run

```bash
sail up -d
```

To stop the container run

```bash
sail stop
```

## ElectroBlocks

Today I finished the FastLED / Neopixel intro lesson.  I also scheduled two meetups.  I am thinking about making FAST LED into 4 lessons.  Then moving onto LCD screens and combining them with sonar sensor or light sensor.


I also fixed a [bug](https://github.com/ElectroBlocks/ElectroBlocks/issues/93) a where the list get item or set item was not showing all the list variables possible.  This was a cheap fix I did in the blockly code so that create list blocks would only show one variable but the get and set item blocks should show all the variables.

### Code Change Here

## Personal Note

I don't do well with criticism.  I need to work on that.  I take it as way too seriously and I chew on it for way too long.  The truth is that adults are going to disagree when I ideas are presented to them.  It's ok be disagree and that's actually a good thing.  I should be tolerant and accepting of other people's ideas but also be willing to have my own ideas as well.  It's all a balance.

Having admited that I also need to be willing to leave a space or not look at something for a few days.  Whatever it takes to not over analyze a situation.  It's important to move forward and not backwards.  In other words keep what I like and leave the rest.
