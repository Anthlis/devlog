## Hacking With Swift Day 55

Today I learned about creating a custom node tree in a game and about async timers.

## iOS Game Node Graph

Let's take [WhackSlot Class](https://github.com/phptuts/100DaysOfSwift/blob/master/Project14/Project14/WhackSlot.swift).  You can look at it like creating components or HTML.  For the penguin node to hide, it must be inside a CropNode.

```html
<WhackSlot>
    <WhackHole />
    <CropNode>
      <PenguinNode />
    <CropNode />
</WhackSlot>
```

## Dispatch Queue Async After

"asyncAfter" is the javascript equivalent of setTimeout.  It will run a closure after x number of seconds.  You can see the example [here](https://github.com/phptuts/100DaysOfSwift/blob/master/Project14/Project14/GameScene.swift#L98).  Notice we're using it to have the function call itself recursively.

```swift
DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + delay) {
            [weak self] in
            self?.createEnemy()
        }
```

## PostGIS In Action

Today I learned about PostGIS and some of its competitors.  I was surprised to learn that Microsoft SQL supports geolocation queries.  

### Question Spatial SQL database can answer.

The biggest thing that got reinforced was the types of questions a geospatial database can answer.  
What it allows us to do is combine location data with SQL data.


### Questions

- If an airport is put in location x, how many homes within a 5-mile radius will be affected?
- How many customers that make over 20,000 dollars live within a 20-mile radius of x?
- How many voting machines do we need an zip code Y?

### PostGIS Installation

Run these commands after installing psql.

```bash
CREATE DATABASE postgis_in_action;
CREATE SCHEMA postgis;
GRANT USAGE ON schema postgis to public;
CREATE EXTENSION postgis SCHEMA postgis;
ALTER DATABASE postgis_in_action SET search_path=public,postgis,contrib;

```

Run this command to confirm everything works.

```bash
SELECT postgis_full_version();
```

### PostGIS Spatial Types


- Geometry:  Exists in a 2D plane.  You can draw all the basic 2D shapes like triangles, polygons, points, etc.  It's not as accurate as geography, but it is a lot faster.
- Geography: This allows you to draw shapes on the world.  It's not as fast and requires more math because it considers the curvature of the earth.
- Raster: Is for querying pixel images.  You can query areas in the photos.
- Network Topology:  This is for connecting nodes and edges together geospatially.  Think of it as the shortest distance between points via car.  This one is crazy cool!
