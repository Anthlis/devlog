# ElectroBlocks - 2022

## Day 1 - 2022-01-01

So I am not in a position to do anything for ElectroBlocks.  It's all on my other computer.  The big realization that I had for tutorial creation is to be selfish in a good way.  Rather than trying to get views or to get popular.  I should focus my time on creating videos and content that I geniunely enjoy creating.  I should focus on creating stuff for what I am learning and it should be useful reference for me.   I should create things that excite me.  I need to selfish in a good way.  I will get back on ElectroBlocks tomorrow.   Noting moves in a straight line.  

I also want to start designing my vs code extension for learning how to code.  So I will be switching between electroblocks and that.  I need to design that and take time to think about the architecture, but not over think it.  There is ony so much value in optimizing code before it loses value.  The key is to find the sweet spot. 

## Day 2 - 2022-01-04

Today I got a video complete for coding alternating patterns with an LED light strip.  I am getting better at editting the videos and making things work.

## Day 3 - 2022-01-05

Today I got up the alternating rgb led lights pattern.  I was able to upload the lessons.  I aslo started on the snake pattern.  I found a bug in block code so I will have to record it.

Overall I am feeling good that I got something done.

## Day 4 - 2022-01-06

Today I got in the snake video.  It felt good to get that done!  I am starting to have a real collection of lessons which feels great!

## Day 5 - 2022-01-08

I got a lot of feedback on my streaming rainbow video from my partner.  I realized that I needed only one slide to explain how we moved the data in the array.  He was very generous with his time, and I am grateful for that!

## Day 6 - 2022-01-09

Today I made the slides for explaining streaming rgb led rainbow lights.  It gonna take a bit to explain to someone without experience but I feel it's worth it for the person learning.
