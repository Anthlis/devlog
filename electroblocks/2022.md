# ElectroBlocks - 2022

## Day 1 - 2022-01-01

So I am not in a position to do anything for ElectroBlocks.  It's all on my other computer.  The big realization that I had for tutorial creation is to be selfish in a good way.  Rather than trying to get views or to get popular.  I should focus my time on creating videos and content that I geniunely enjoy creating.  I should focus on creating stuff for what I am learning and it should be useful reference for me.   I should create things that excite me.  I need to selfish in a good way.  I will get back on ElectroBlocks tomorrow.   Noting moves in a straight line.  

I also want to start designing my vs code extension for learning how to code.  So I will be switching between electroblocks and that.  I need to design that and take time to think about the architecture, but not over think it.  There is ony so much value in optimizing code before it loses value.  The key is to find the sweet spot. 

## Day 2 - 2022-01-04

Today I got a video complete for coding alternating patterns with an LED light strip.  I am getting better at editting the videos and making things work.

## Day 3 - 2022-01-05

Today I got up the alternating rgb led lights pattern.  I was able to upload the lessons.  I aslo started on the snake pattern.  I found a bug in block code so I will have to record it.

Overall I am feeling good that I got something done.

## Day 4 - 2022-01-06

Today I got in the snake video.  It felt good to get that done!  I am starting to have a real collection of lessons which feels great!

## Day 5 - 2022-01-08

I got a lot of feedback on my streaming rainbow video from my partner.  I realized that I needed only one slide to explain how we moved the data in the array.  He was very generous with his time, and I am grateful for that!

## Day 6 - 2022-01-09

Today I made the slides for explaining streaming rgb led rainbow lights.  It gonna take a bit to explain to someone without experience but I feel it's worth it for the person learning.

## Day 7 - 2022-01-10

Today I had a class for ElectroBlocks.  It went really well.  I learned that people get confused about the popup and they don't think it's part of the lesson.  I think I can fix that by integrating it more into the site.  I have a few idea.  I also was not prepared today.  I will do better next week!  I think if I integrated the lessons directly into part where the virtual circuit is it would make it more obvious.  This will take a lot of work which ok!

## Day 8 - 2022-01-11

I fixed a bug where the server was down.  It was great because a user emailed me.  I was touched that someone was emailing me and using the project.  I was able to fix the server, and I got ssh working with my computer.  Overall I am feeling good.

## Day 9 - 2022-01-13

Today I thought about the redesign for the ElectroBlocks lessons.  So one thing I noticed was that as people taking the course, they thought the popup was an ad and clicked away from it.  The students thought the simulator was the actual lesson.  So I looked at tinkercad and got some inspiration.  What if we made the lessons on the left of the page built right into code.  They stayed with the page until the user clicked a close button.  This picture is a super rough draft, but I am thinking here.

## Day 10 - 2022-01-14

Today I debugged a server problem which was too much disk space.  The same person emailed me again, saying that the server was down.  I was able to fix it and debug the problem.  It turns out the logs were causing the issue.  

I had to delete the logs by removing a few files.

```bash
/home/nodejs/.pm2/logs
~/.pm2/logs
```

I also had added 100 GB to the server and shrank the server down a bit.  When I did that, I had to restart Nginx.

```bash
/etc/init.d/nginx restart
```

I also installed ncdu and ran ncdu /

The result is that I am now on a schedule where I check the server every day to compile, and I check disk space once a month.
