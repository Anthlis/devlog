# ElectroBlocks - 2022

## Day 1 - 2022-01-01

So I am not in a position to do anything for ElectroBlocks.  It's all on my other computer.  The big realization that I had for tutorial creation is to be selfish in a good way.  Rather than trying to get views or to get popular.  I should focus my time on creating videos and content that I geniunely enjoy creating.  I should focus on creating stuff for what I am learning and it should be useful reference for me.   I should create things that excite me.  I need to selfish in a good way.  I will get back on ElectroBlocks tomorrow.   Noting moves in a straight line.  

I also want to start designing my vs code extension for learning how to code.  So I will be switching between electroblocks and that.  I need to design that and take time to think about the architecture, but not over think it.  There is ony so much value in optimizing code before it loses value.  The key is to find the sweet spot. 

## Day 2 - 2022-01-04

Today I got a video complete for coding alternating patterns with an LED light strip.  I am getting better at editting the videos and making things work.

## Day 3 - 2022-01-05

Today I got up the alternating rgb led lights pattern.  I was able to upload the lessons.  I aslo started on the snake pattern.  I found a bug in block code so I will have to record it.

Overall I am feeling good that I got something done.

## Day 4 - 2022-01-06

Today I got in the snake video.  It felt good to get that done!  I am starting to have a real collection of lessons which feels great!

## Day 5 - 2022-01-08

I got a lot of feedback on my streaming rainbow video from my partner.  I realized that I needed only one slide to explain how we moved the data in the array.  He was very generous with his time, and I am grateful for that!

## Day 6 - 2022-01-09

Today I made the slides for explaining streaming rgb led rainbow lights.  It gonna take a bit to explain to someone without experience but I feel it's worth it for the person learning.

## Day 7 - 2022-01-10

Today I had a class for ElectroBlocks.  It went really well.  I learned that people get confused about the popup and they don't think it's part of the lesson.  I think I can fix that by integrating it more into the site.  I have a few idea.  I also was not prepared today.  I will do better next week!  I think if I integrated the lessons directly into part where the virtual circuit is it would make it more obvious.  This will take a lot of work which ok!

## Day 8 - 2022-01-11

I fixed a bug where the server was down.  It was great because a user emailed me.  I was touched that someone was emailing me and using the project.  I was able to fix the server, and I got ssh working with my computer.  Overall I am feeling good.

## Day 9 - 2022-01-13

Today I thought about the redesign for the ElectroBlocks lessons.  So one thing I noticed was that as people taking the course, they thought the popup was an ad and clicked away from it.  The students thought the simulator was the actual lesson.  So I looked at tinkercad and got some inspiration.  What if we made the lessons on the left of the page built right into code.  They stayed with the page until the user clicked a close button.  This picture is a super rough draft, but I am thinking here.

### New

## Day 10 - 2022-01-14

Today I debugged a server problem which was too much disk space.  The same person emailed me again, saying that the server was down.  I was able to fix it and debug the problem.  It turns out the logs were causing the issue.  

I had to delete the logs by removing a few files.

```bash
/home/nodejs/.pm2/logs
~/.pm2/logs
```

I also had added 100 GB to the server and shrank the server down a bit.  When I did that, I had to restart Nginx.

```bash
/etc/init.d/nginx restart
```

I also installed ncdu and ran ncdu /

The result is that I am now on a schedule where I check the server every day to compile, and I check disk space once a month.

## Day 11 - 2022-01-15

Today I worked on the new lesson layout.  I actually got to use an advanced functional programming technique called currying.  Where I had a function return a function with a preset argument. I needed this to reduce code duplication for resizing the left and right side of the screen.

```js
 const resize = (side) => {
    return (e) => {
      if (!isResizingLeft && side == 'left') {
        return;
      }

      if (!isResizingRight && side == 'right') {
        return;
      }
...
}
```

I use that to create two functions.

```js
  const resizeRightSide = _.debounce(resize('right'), 2);
  const resizeLeftSide = _.debounce(resize('left'), 2);

```

I starting to really like my new layouts.  I might even make it default and get rid of the lessons page.

## Day 12 - 2022-01-16

I decided to continue the refactoring of the lessons page. I decided to go with a typescript array versus storing things in the firebase database. I think that will be simpler long term. I also got rid of the search for lessons; I submitted my stuff for some feedback, and I am planning on emailing people. I hope to be done with the final project tomorrow and test it out at noisebridge. Overall this will simplify the code and make everything easier to read.

### Side Note 

Look into upgrading to firebase 9 so that you don't have to upgrade to sveltekit and firebase 9 at one time.  Lower risk!

## Day 13 - 2022-01-17

Today I did Circuit Hacking Mondays at noisebridge. I learned a few things.

- I need the word pin in the LED Block
- All videos need sound.  It matters!
- The video layout on the side makes the most sense to people
- Consider changing the wait block to say lock, expand, or delay.  (I am leaning toward lock)
- There is a bug in the uploading Arduino Code

I also reached out to the [DruinoApp](https://duino.app/#/).  Here is there [DruinoApp Code](https://github.com/duinoapp/duinoapp-client).  They have superior uploading and Arduino compiling abilities.  I want to see if I can work with them to copy their uploading code to my site and start using their server.  I would pay them, of course.  Overall it was a very productive day.  I got a ton of compliments!  I am grateful to be a part of noisebridge, and I realize the importance of community in my life!

## Day 14 - 2022-01-18

Today was a very productive day.  I made a ton of progress!  I got a response from mrfrase3, and mrfrase3 agreed to let me use his server, and I agreed to pay him $20 a month.  This will be a considerable saving and, I believe, a win for both parties.  I will also copy his version of the uploading code to Arduino.  He did a much better job than I did, and he also supports way more boards than I do.  I can tell he's are a DevOps pro.

I also made more progress on getting the PR ready for the new education layout.  I got it working with and without the lessons.  Here is what I want to finish before I pull the trigger.

- Adding all the starter kits and videos lessons
- Making it so that the lessons stay open until you click close.
- Removing any popup-related lesson stuff.
- Send a message to the blockly page to make it say the right thing in the loop

Hoping to be done with the PR by thursday and to start work on the refactoring arduino flashing by Friday.  Everything a work in progress, LOL.

## Day 15 - 2022-01-19

Today I did item 2, making the lesson stay open or be opened anywhere.  To do this, I used a store to control whether the lesson page was open or not.  This was a good idea because I had to update the layout.  I am excited to be working on this.  I think by tomorrow I should have everything ready to go for a pr.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9620015/150300747-b63f3bf8-fbb8-4eda-ae03-bc52d42f5f35.mov


## Day 16 - 2022-01-20

Today was another good day.  I did not finish the pr, but I did get through, making the page moveable.  I found a giant bug where I was discounting the left side of the screen for resizing calculations if the lessons page was off.  It should have been reversed.  I also fixed the Blockly loop problem.  I then found another bug where the simulator was not resizing when selecting the lessons.  

What I am happy about is that I figured all this complex UI logic out.  I really like the look of everything.  I think tomorrow I should be able to have a finished pr and be ready to merge on Saturday.  Then comes the major refactor of using Druino app.

## Day 17 - 2022-01-21

Today I got the pr complete and the new lessons deployed!  It felt good to remove a ton of code from and simplify everything.  I feel great about the new layout.  I know I need to redo the videos again with sound, which I will do soon, now onto the switch to Druino App's server.  It should be a good challenge!

## Day 18 - 19 - 2022-01-23

Yesterday and today I worked on transferring druino app and avrgirl-arduino code over to ElectroBlocks.  The big blockers where removing vue from the code and finding a browser replacement for Buffer.js  I eventually found one and I was also able to remove Vue.   So far so good.  I can tell that his Duino App's implementation of avrgirl's code is way better than mine.  Already getting better results.  I might have to work on Serial input.  I think it's getting cut off at times.

## Day 20 - 21 - 2022-01-24

I have decide to start exploring other options other than chrome serial.  Mainly the arduino plugin.  

https://github.com/arduino/arduino-create-agent-js-client

There is example of uploading a hex file here:

https://github.com/arduino/arduino-create-agent-js-client/blob/master/demo/app.jsx#L204

I feel that I will get better use and less bugs.  It's too buggy and too complicated for me to manage chrome usb stuff.  It doesn't work sapper.  I could go on and on but I won't.

## 21 - 2022-01-26

Today I made some progress on getting the arduino plugin up with up with electroBlocks.  I had to do some dirty stuff to get the module to work with SSR.  I am hoping that I can disable SSR in sveltekit.  I believe I can.  The good news is that it's working super well!!!

```js
const Daemon = (await import('arduino-create-agent-js-client')).default
      .default;
    console.log(Daemon);
    const chromeExtensionID = 'hfejhkbipnickajaidoppbadcomekkde';

    const daemon = new Daemon(
      'https://builder.arduino.cc/v3/boards',
      chromeExtensionID
    );
```

### File an issue

I filed an issue today with Arduino people about this:

https://github.com/arduino/arduino-create-agent-js-client/issues/543

I am hopeful that they will get back with me on this issue.

## 22 - 2022-01-27

I decided today that I am going to be learning GoLang so that I can modify the Arduino Agent.  I want it to do two things.  

1\. I want it to be able to use the arduino cli so that we I can have an offline mode
2\. I want to be able to add origins to the config file so that I can have ElectroBlocks work with the site.

I know both things are very possible.  The thing is that all this takes time and I have all the time I need because no one is paying me.  I bought a Go course from Stephen Grinder today.  Planning on doing that for the next few weeks and building out the Sapper code to work with it all.

## 23 - 2022-01-28

Today I learned a lot about Golang.  I am learning it for modifying the [Arduino Create Agent](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-create-agent).  It has a radically different syntax.  Between this and Swift, my brain is maxed out.  Go has a different philosophy as well.  It's not OOP, and it's super functional.  It's what you would expect from a performance-based language.  I will be grateful when I hear back from the Arduino people and see if they are open to either putting me on the origin list or making the change to the agent.


## 24 - 2022-01-31

I am still learning GoLang.  It's a tough language.  Today I hosted Circuit Hacking Monday and I got a response from the Arduino people about the create agent.  I am hopeful that we can use it to upload the code.  Hopefully they will take a pr from me!  Feeling good overall.

## 25 - 2022-02-05

I made a big decision.  I decided to other to code ElectroBlocks into the new Arduino IDE.  I feel that this would reach more people and it would be better for both parties.  I hopeful that they will be open to working with me on this project.   I think this would be great landing spot for ElectroBlocks project.

https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/issues/811

They are using theia to build their new IDE which is very simular to vs code.

## 26- 2022-02-08 Declaring Bankruptcy  

I have to conclude that ElectroBlocks has failed.  That app is not going to be used by a lot of people.  I feel like it was a waste of time.  I have been ghosted by numerous people who pretend to be interested in it.  I have tried my best to promote it.  I have taken so much advice that it makes me sick.  As far as this ever being popular, I have concluded it has no shot.  No one cares.  I am not sure why, and I am done taking it personally.  The only use for this is for my classes and a portfolio piece.  That's it!  Four years of my life down the drain.  It's a bitter pill to take.  

### Schools/Teachers won't adopt it in their classrooms

- Arduino confuse people with the number of pins.  The MicroBit is so much simpler, which is why it's dominant in classrooms.
- I am not an institution, so it's harder for them to take me seriously.  Teachers, in general, are super busy, and they trust what they trust.
- Getting into schools usually requires a team, something I can't build on my own.  It's not in the cards.  

### I can't get uploading to work with Chrome Serial

- Flashing the Arduino with Chrome Serial has been a failure
- It's just not reliable, and avrgirl is not stable.  The library says this much, so I can't be angry about it.

### Institutions won't adopt the project

- I have tried reaching out to Arduino and other large institutions.  I got back some responses, but nothing as panned out.  Arduino said they would get back to me over six months ago.  It's not happening.  This issue was a last-ditch effort.  It's not going to happen.

### So where do I go from here

Here is what I have decided to do.  Finish the project.  That means taking it to the point where I can use it in my classes.  Turn it into a desktop app that uses the Arduino-CLI.  That way, it does not cost me any money.  Stop asking people for advice on videos and anything else related to ElectroBlocks.  Just do it for fun and to have fun teaching it to people.  Once it turns into a desktop app, I will disable uploading from the browser, and I will also take out firebase from the desktop app.  Eventually, I might do the MicroBit and allow uploading there.  But that's only if I feel like it. 

Sometimes you have to cut through the bullshit and admit defeat.  By the end of the year, my goal is to finish the app part of this ride.  Maybe I will do some cool tutorials or move on to another project.  


### What I have learned

Whatever I do in my life, it's probably never going to take off or be successful.  It sucks, but that's the reality of it.  Everything I do should be done with some selfish intentions.  I should do these projects and videos for myself and me alone.  It's not about the other person; it's about me having fun and maybe seeing a few people smile.  If it's not convenient or a pain in the ass for me to do something, I won't do it.  I am declaring bankruptcy on that kind of success.  There is no get rich quick scheme, and there is no way for me to become famous.  It's over, and I am done with startup and other forms of snake oil salesmen.  I am only doing projects I enjoy them.  Fuck everyone else when it comes to this part of my life.  If I don't like it, I am out.  I am done with people and their empty promises.  I know it's all bullshit!

## 27 - 2022-02-21 Back on it!

I have to keep moving forward with this.  It might not be destined for a big success but that doesn't matter.  What I want is a kick-ass tool that I can use to teach people to code with the Arduino.  If that's all that this becomes then it was a success. 

Today I fixed a major UI bug where I was drawing the resistors wrong for the led.  I also made the code clear in the createResistor function.  Now isDown changed to isConnecting which means that the resistor is connecting both sides of the breadboard.  I also drew a wire between the resistor and the terminal.  I also simplified the ground wire.  Overall it was productive.

I will never give up on my dream to build tools to help people learn!  Sometimes great rejection and pain are required for success.  I will go through that pain and rejection.  

## 28 - 2022-03-01 New Month New Focus

So I am done complaining about this. I have done some serious journaling and I have decided to keep working on it as a tool to get people excited about coding.   

Today I started the process of upgrading firebase which will take care of some of the major security concerns.  The rest will wait till I move the project over to svelte kit.  I am about 90% code complete.  I am also planning on studying svelte / electron more and moving the project towards that for Arduinos.
