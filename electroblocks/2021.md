# ElectroBlocks - 2021 

## 2021-12-29

Today I started on the rbg led light strip video for ElectroBlocks.  I also took screenshots of blocks and I am getting ready for the three videos I need to make.

Today I finished the FastLED / Neopixel intro lesson.  I also scheduled two meetups.  I am thinking about making FAST LED into 4 lessons.  Then moving onto LCD screens and combining them with sonar sensor or light sensor.


I also fixed a [bug](https://github.com/ElectroBlocks/ElectroBlocks/issues/93) a where the list get item or set item was not showing all the list variables possible.  This was a cheap fix I did in the blockly code so that create list blocks would only show one variable but the get and set item blocks should show all the variables.

Today I did a rainbow streaming pattern in ElectroBlocks.  It was tough because we don't have a push or pop functions on arrays I had to do it by hand.

I notice that my c code was not compiling.  I was using an RGB struct

```c
struct RGB {
	int red;
	int green;
	int blue;
};
```

When you create a struct or an array of structs it turns out you need to put the struct keyword before the variable.

```c
struct RGB tempColor = {0, 0, 0};

struct RGB colors[30];
```

You can see the code changes here:

Here is the ElectroBlocks XML file to upload the code to ElectroBlocks

Github does not let me do XML files change the extension to XML and run if you want to test it out in the future.
