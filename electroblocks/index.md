# ElectroBlocks

This is my personal journey with [ElectroBlocks](https://electroblocks.org). I started recording it a few days ago.  My goal is to keep track of the progress and to see how far I have come with the project.  Electroblocks is a Arduino Blocky IDE that combines video editting concepts with code.  I have been working on this project for years so this is not the beginning of the journey.  I think I started working on this around 2016
