## Hacking With Swift Day 51

Today I watched two talks given by Paul Hudson on Swift.  One went over function programming.  I learned about compactMap and wrote a simple example on how to use it.  

```swift
import UIKit

let list = ["3", "non", "6", "5"]

// If the transformation fails it filter it out of the array and removes all
// This will print [3, 6, 5]
print(list.compactMap { Int($0) })  // $0 is the first argument in the array

// this print [Optional(3), nil, Optional(6), Optional(5)]
print(list.map { Int($0)})

// Filter
// Swift has standard filter method

// This will print [6, 5]
print(list.compactMap{ Int($0)}.filter{ $0 > 3})


```

I also learned about user defaults

```swift

// userdefault.standard.register defaults
let defaults = UserDefaults.standard
defaults.register(defaults: <#T##[String : Any]#>)

```

I also learned that it's better to throw an exception than return an optional.  Optionals should be avoided if possible.

## Laravel

Today we went over database migrations and Eloquent models in Tinker.

I did learn that you can pass multiple ids in the static find function and it will return a collection of values.


```php
BlogPost::find([1,3,4]);
```

If 3 and 4 exist in the database and 1 does not it wil return a collection of 2 BlogPost.


## ElectroBlocks

Today I did a rainbow streaming pattern in ElectroBlocks.  It was tough because we don't have a push or pop functions on arrays I had to do it by hand.

I notice that my c code was not compiling.  I was using an RGB struct

```c
struct RGB {
	int red;
	int green;
	int blue;
};
```

When you create a struct or an array of structs it turns out you need to put the struct keyword before the variable.

```c
struct RGB tempColor = {0, 0, 0};

struct RGB colors[30];
```

You can see the code changes here:

Here is the ElectroBlocks XML file to upload the code to ElectroBlocks

Github does not let me do XML files change the extension to XML and run if you want to test it out in the future.

## Firebase 9 Course

I took a course by net ninja on firebase 9.  Firebase 9 radically changed to a functional approach.  Once you get use to the functional approach it's not super hard to use.

I have the repo committed here with the notes.  I will update the notes tomorrow.  I am little pooped.
