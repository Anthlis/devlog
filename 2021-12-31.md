## Hacking With Swift Day 51

Today I watched two talks given by Paul Hudson on Swift.  One went over function programming.  I learned about compactMap and wrote a simple example on how to use it.  

```swift
import UIKit

let list = ["3", "non", "6", "5"]

// If the transformation fails it filter it out of the array and removes all
// This will print [3, 6, 5]
print(list.compactMap { Int($0) })  // $0 is the first argument in the array

// this print [Optional(3), nil, Optional(6), Optional(5)]
print(list.map { Int($0)})

// Filter
// Swift has standard filter method

// This will print [6, 5]
print(list.compactMap{ Int($0)}.filter{ $0 > 3})


```

I also learned about user defaults

```swift

// userdefault.standard.register defaults
let defaults = UserDefaults.standard
defaults.register(defaults: <#T##[String : Any]#>)

```

I also learned that it's better to throw an exception than return an optional.  Optionals should be avoided if possible.
