# devlog

This is record of everything I am doing life wise and dev wise in my life.  I am grateful for the opportunity to live a great life and I am embracing everything that has been given to me.  My goal with this is to foster more healthy self confidence, keep track of everything I am learning, and to live with more purpose.
