# #100DaysOfSwift Day 58 - 2022-01-07

Today I got practice animations with swift.  It was fun the challenging part was remembering how to reset all the images and everything back.

I did things the hard way in code but the better way is to use .identity.  That will reset it back.

```swift
button.transform = .identity
```
