# 100DaysOfSwift Day 76.5 - 2022-01-26


Day 76 1/2 of #100DaysOfSwift.  Today I talked with my Swift mentor for an hour.  I will extend my 100 days of Swift to more than 100 days so I can continue to talk with him.  We reviewed some of the code, and he gave me a good coding challenge that he had to do for an interview.  https://github.com/EverlyWell/swift-challenge#1-the-everly-health-demo-project  Planning on taking this on over the weekend.   Grateful I have a good mentor!
