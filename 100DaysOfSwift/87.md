# 100DaysOfSwift Day 87 - 2022-02-07

Today was a challenge day.  I figured out how to load random levels.  I refactored the code to clarify what was going on when a level gets created.  I also created a unique space type for teleporting the ball.

## Refactoring Level Code

I devided it into three function and two are helper functions. 

### Helper functions

1\. Loads the file - fetchLevelFromFile
2\. Creates the space - createSpace


### Refactored Code

``` swift
func loadLevel(fileName: String, randomize: Bool = false) {
      let lines = fetchLevelFromFile(fileName: fileName)
      for (row, line) in lines.reversed().enumerated() {
          for (column, letter) in line.enumerated() {
            createSpace(space: letter, column: column, row: row)
          }
      }
  }
```

## Creating random level

I create another text file that shows always has spaces to get to the trophy. 

```txt
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
x xs      xs  sx
x xxxxxx vx vv x
x         x vv x
x xxx xx  x    x
xsxvx       xv x
xvxsxxxsx xxxv x
xxx xsxx  v    x
x           vxxx
x vvvvvvvvvvvvfx
x              x
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

I then modified the loadLevel to take an optional randomize boolean that will allow the levels to randomize if the space is a wall, vortex, or star.  I leave all spaces alone.

```swift
// All spaces should remain to guarantee a path
if letter == " " {
    continue
}

// row = 0 or column = 0 that means it must be wall because it's on the perimeter
// if it's f that means it's trophy and we should leave it a long
if !randomize || row == 0 || column == 0 || row == 11 || column == 15 || letter == "f" || letter == "t" || letter == "l" {
    createSpace(space: letter, column: column, row: row)
    continue
} else {
    let spaces = "xxxxvvvs"
    if let space = spaces.randomElement() {
        createSpace(space: space, column: column, row: row)
    }
}
```

The response code for winning the game increase the level count by one which updates the level label.  It uses SKActions to make the ball disappear and restart the game.

```swift
  } else if node.name == "finish" {
    self.clearLevel()
    self.loadLevel(fileName: "level-random", randomize: true)
    player.physicsBody?.isDynamic = false
    let remove = SKAction.removeFromParent()
    let wait = SKAction.wait(forDuration: 0.5)
    let scale = SKAction.scaleX(to: 0.0001, duration: 0.25)

    let start = SKAction.run {
        [weak self] in
        self?.level += 1
        self?.createPlayer()
    }

    player.run(SKAction.sequence([scale, wait, start, remove]))


}
```

## Teleporting

I created two spaces one with l and one with t.  The "t" space is the teleport space and the "l" space is where the ball gets teleported to.  

I named the spaces "teleport" and "landing" so that in the update function I can filter all child node and find the landing space move the ball there.

```swift
        } else if space == "t" || space == "l" {
            // load vortex
            let node = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "teleport")
            node.name = space == "t" ? "teleport" : "landing"

```

```swift
else if node.name == "teleport" {
    player.physicsBody?.isDynamic = false
    let move = SKAction.move(to: node.position, duration: 0.25)
    let scale = SKAction.scaleX(to: 0.0001, duration: 0.25)
    let sequence = SKAction.sequence([move, scale])
    player.run(sequence) {
        [weak self] in
        if let landing =  self?.children.first(where: { $0.name == "landing"}) {
            self?.player.position = landing.position
            let scale = SKAction.scaleX(to: 1, duration: 0.25)
            self?.player.run(scale)
            self?.player.physicsBody?.isDynamic = true
        }
    }
}
```
