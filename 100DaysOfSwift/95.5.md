# 100DaysOfSwift Day 95.5 - 2022-02-13

Today I did only one of the 20 minute videos.  I learned got some good review on collision detection in games.  I also learned how to an altas which combines all the sprites images into one big image.  He also went over some physics and math involved in launching the banana.

## Launch Code

1\. First we create the banana and clear out any left banana
2\. Set up it's physic body
3\. Raise and lower the players arm
4\. To some math launch the banana in the direction that the player wants

```swift
func launch(angle: Int, velocity: Int) {
        let speed = Double(velocity) / 10
        let radians = deg2rad(deg: angle)
        
        if banana != nil {
            banana.removeFromParent()
            banana = nil
        }
        
        banana = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "banana")
        banana.name = "banana"
        banana.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(circleOfRadius: banana.size.width / 2)
        banana.physicsBody?.categoryBitMask = CollisionTypes.banana.rawValue
        banana.physicsBody?.collisionBitMask = CollisionTypes.building.rawValue | CollisionTypes.player.rawValue
        banana.physicsBody?.contactTestBitMask = CollisionTypes.building.rawValue | CollisionTypes.player.rawValue

        banana.physicsBody?.usesPreciseCollisionDetection = true
        addChild(banana)
        
        if currentPlayer == 1 {
            banana.position = CGPoint(x: player1.position.x - 30, y: player1.position.y + 40)
            banana.physicsBody?.angularVelocity = -20
            
            let raiseArm = SKAction.setTexture(SKTexture(imageNamed: "player1Throw"))
            let lowerArm = SKAction.setTexture(SKTexture(imageNamed: "player"))
            let pause = SKAction.wait(forDuration: 0.15)
            
            let sequence = SKAction.sequence([raiseArm, pause, lowerArm])
            player1.run(sequence)
            
            let impulse = CGVector(dx: cos(radians) * speed, dy: sin(radians) * speed)
            banana.physicsBody?.applyImpulse(impulse)
        } else {
            banana.position = CGPoint(x: player2.position.x + 30, y: player2.position.y + 40)
            banana.physicsBody?.angularVelocity = 20
            
            let raiseArm = SKAction.setTexture(SKTexture(imageNamed: "player2Throw"))
            let lowerArm = SKAction.setTexture(SKTexture(imageNamed: "player"))
            let pause = SKAction.wait(forDuration: 0.15)
            
            let sequence = SKAction.sequence([raiseArm, pause, lowerArm])
            player2.run(sequence)
            
            let impulse = CGVector(dx: cos(radians) * -speed, dy: sin(radians) * speed)
            banana.physicsBody?.applyImpulse(impulse)

        }
    }
```
