# 100DaysOfSwift Day 64 - 2022-01-13

Today I learned about debugging and various strategies around debugging.  

- Print
- Assert
- Break points

## Print

The function can take in any number of arguments.

```swift
print(1,3,4,5)
// prints 1 2 3 4 5
```

You can use the optional separator argument to control what goes in between each argument.

```swift
print(1,2,3,4,5, separator: "-")
// prints 1-2-3-4-5
```

You can also use the terminator to control what gets printed at the end of output.  Default is a new line.

```swift
print("Some message", terminator: "")
print("AGAIN")
// prints Some messageAGAIN
```

## Assert

Assert is used to verify something is true while building your app. Asserts will be stripped away in the final production build. Assert is handy for making sure things are right while you're developing.

```swift
assert(1 == 1)
assert(1 == 2) // This will cause your code to crash while your building your app.
```
## Breakpoints

Break points pause your code and allow you see the state of all the variables in your code.

### Creating break point

Click on the number that you want your code to pause.

### Togglign off breakpoint

Click on the breakpoint you want toggle off. It will look somewhat grayed out.

### Execution Threads

This contains the stacktrace and the threads that are running in your app.

### Conditional Breakpoints

These will only stop the code when a condition is met.
