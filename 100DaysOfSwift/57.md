# #100DaysOfSwift Day 57 - 2022-01-06

Today I learned about the various kinds of animations. It's pretty easy to do them

## Examples

These animations will have a bit of a spring
```swift
        UIView.animate(withDuration: 1, delay: 0, usingSpringWithDamping: 0.5, initialSpringVelocity: 5, options: [], animations: {
                // scale up
                self.imageView.transform = CGAffineTransform(scaleX: 2, y: 2)

}) { finished in
// executes after everything done
}
```

```swift
// non spring animations
UIView.animateKeyframes(withDuration: 1, delay: 0, options: []) {
```
