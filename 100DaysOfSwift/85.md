# 100DaysOfSwift Day 85 - 2022-02-06

Today I learned how to load a level from a file.  It's a cool way to design a level.  I also learned why use fatalError function, and more collision detection.

```txt
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
x xs      xs  sx
x xxxxxx vx vv x
x         x vv x
x xxx xxxxx    x
xsxvxs      xv x
xvxsxxxxxxxxxv x
xxx xxxxxxvs   x
x          svxxx
x vvvvvvvvvvvvfx
x              x
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Why use fatalError

To signal that your app or game is missing something fundamental that will make the experience terrible.  If it fails by your code you will know exactly why and where it's failing so you can fix it.


In this example we are failing because we can't load the txt file.
```swift
guard let levelUrl = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "level1", withExtension: "txt") else {
            fatalError("Cound find level.txt in the app bundle")
        }
```

## How load level works

1. Load the contents of the file

```swift
guard let levelUrl = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "level1", withExtension: "txt") else {
            fatalError("Cound find level.txt in the app bundle")
        }
        
        guard let levelString = try? String(contentsOf: levelUrl) else {
            fatalError("Could load level.txt in the app bundle")
        }
```


2\. Loop through the lines in the text file and characters in the text.  We reverse the first one because we are starting at bottom and work our way to the top.

```swift
        let lines = levelString.components(separatedBy: "\n")
        
        for (row, line) in lines.reversed().enumerated() {
            for (column, letter) in line.enumerated() {
            
            }
         }
```

3\. Inside the for loops we create each type of sprite node.

```swift
                let position = CGPoint(x: (64 * column) + 32, y: (64 * row) + 32)
                
                if letter == "x" {
                    // load wall
                    let node = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "block")
                    node.position = position
                    node.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(rectangleOf: node.size)
                    node.physicsBody?.categoryBitMask = CollisionTypes.wall.rawValue
                    node.physicsBody?.isDynamic = false
                    addChild(node)
                } else if letter == "v" {

```
