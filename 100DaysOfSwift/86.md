# 100DaysOfSwift Day 86 - 2022-02-06

Today I learned how to write code that only runs on the simulator or real device.  I learned how to access the accelerometer data which tells the code how much the iPad is tilted.  I also learned more about colission detection with the player.  We also practice SKActions.
