# 100DaysOfSwift Day 65 - 2022-01-14

Today was a challenge day.  I practiced asserts, exception breakpoints and condition breakpoint


## Exception BreakPoints

These are special breakpoints that trigger when an excepton happens.  In this case I caused by try to navigate to a view controller that does not exist.

## Asserts

Asserts are used to make sure something exists while developing your app.  Once you deploy to the app store, asserts will be stripped out of your code.  They are handy for debugging.  In the example we are making sure the selectedImage in the view controller is not null.

```
 assert(selectedImage != nil)
```

## Conditional Breakpoints

Conditional breakpoints trigger when a condition in your code is meant.  If the submitted answer is longer than five, the breakpoint will trigger.
