# #100DaysOfSwift Day 54 - 2022-01-03

Today I learned go to practice what my iOS mentor talked about.  Having one variable that contains all the state and then setting a didSet on it so that when something changes all the changes happen in one place.  I also got to practice more core image filter stuff.  I was really happy with the way everything turned out.
