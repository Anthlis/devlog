# 100DaysOfSwift Day 68 - 2022-01-17

Today I tried to do the app extension, but it failed.  I tried it on iOS 15 and 14 and various configurations.  After an hour, I gave up and realized that it was not worth it.  I am skipping the next lesson in favor of playing around with NSNotificationCenter found here:
