# 100DaysOfSwift Day 71 - 2022-01-20

Today I finished the fireworks game tutorial.  I learned how to make the fireworks explode, clean up the explosion with a delayed reaction, and got a lot of practice with didSet and update functions in games.

## Removing a node with SKAction

I used the run function to run a wait for action and rmeoveFromParent action.  This allows the explosion to go off and then deletes it from the scene after 1/2 second.

```swift
emitter.run(SKAction.sequence([
    SKAction.wait(forDuration: 0.5),
    SKAction.removeFromParent()
]))
```

## Updating Score and Tries with DidSet

Using Swift built in reactivity to respond to tries and score variables being set.

```swift
var tries = 5 {
        didSet {
            triesLabel.text = "Tries: \(tries)"
            if tries == 0 {
                
                triesLabel.text = "Last Try"
            }
        }
    }
    
    var score = 0 {
        didSet {
            scoreLabel.text = "Score: \(score)"
        }
    }

```

## Using update function and the checkTouches func

Check is used to start a new game.  We checking that the tries are zero and the children count is less than 5.  This means all the fireworks are off the screen.

```swift
    func checkTouches(_ touches: Set<UITouch>) {
        
        if tries <= 0 &&  children.count < 5 {
            newGame()
            return
        }

        
```

I use the same logic in the update function to update tries label to "Tap to play again"

```swift
override func update(_ currentTime: TimeInterval) {

        
        if children.count < 5 && tries == 0  {
            triesLabel.text = "Tap to play again!"
        }
    }
```

## Using motionBegan to respond to shake events

You run motionBegan function in the game view controller.  This is why there is so type casting.

```swift
    override func motionBegan(_ motion: UIEvent.EventSubtype, with event: UIEvent?) {
        guard let skView = view as? SKView else { return }
        guard let gameScene = skView.scene as? GameScene else { return }
        gameScene.explodeFireworks()
    }
```
