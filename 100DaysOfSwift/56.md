## How to play sound

```swift
   run(SKAction.playSoundFileNamed("whack.caf", waitForCompletion: false))
```

## How to run a sequence of actions

```swift
        let delay = SKAction.wait(forDuration: 0.25)
        let hide = SKAction.moveBy(x: 0, y: -80, duration: 0.5)
        let notVisible = SKAction.run { [weak self] in self?.isVisible = false}
        let showMud = SKAction.run {
            [weak self] in
            self?.showMud()
        }
        let sequence = SKAction.sequence([delay, showMud, hide, notVisible])
```

## How to add a particle effect and remove it after 1/2 second

```swift
if let smokeEmitter = SKEmitterNode(fileNamed: "smoke") {
                smokeEmitter.zPosition = 2
                smokeEmitter.position = location
                addChild(smokeEmitter)
                DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1) {
                    smokeEmitter.removeFromParent()
                }
            }
```

## How to go up the node tree

In this case, we had our custom node WhackNode, and we wanted to see if the penguin was hit.  We are looking to see if it was the penguin we know will always be in WhackNode.  We make sure we deal with the whacknode by typecasting the parent's parent.

```html
<whacknode>
  <charnode>
    <pegquin_node />
  </charnode>
</whacknode>
```

To do that in swift you do this:

```swift
// because this code is in a loop, we use to continue, but most of the time, I use return.
guard let whackSlot = node.parent?.parent as? WhackSlot else { continue }
```
Then you can check the node's name that was hit to see if it's a good penguin or a bad one.
