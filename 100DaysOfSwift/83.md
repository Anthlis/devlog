# 100DaysOfSwift Day 83 - 2022-02-02

Today I learned how to do a peer-to-peer network with iOS. This allows the app to share information from one iPhone directly with another iPhone. We also reviewed collection views and image pickers.  The tutorial is outdated so here are my notes on what I used to fix it.

## Problems

So there were a lot of problems with the tutorial today.  It was out of date and I had to look for a lot of help.  I found someone on the hacking with swift forums who pointed me in the right direction.

1\.  You need to your collection view to use Estimated Size: None.  Otherwise apple will auto size the image for you.

2\.  You need to replace MCAdvertiserAssistant with MCNearbyServiceAdvertiser

```swift
    var peerID = MCPeerID(displayName: UIDevice.current.name)
    
    var mcSession: MCSession?
    
    var mcAdAssistant: MCNearbyServiceAdvertiser?

```

3\. This changes your start hosting function to this.

```swift
func startHosting(via action: UIAlertAction) {
        guard mcSession != nil else { return }
        mcAdAssistant = MCNearbyServiceAdvertiser(peer: peerID, discoveryInfo: nil, serviceType: "hws-project25")
        mcAdAssistant?.delegate = self
        mcAdAssistant?.startAdvertisingPeer()
    }
```

4\. You will then need to create an advertise function that will accept or allow the connection on the host's side.

```swift
func advertiser(_ advertiser: MCNearbyServiceAdvertiser, didReceiveInvitationFromPeer peerID: MCPeerID, withContext context: Data?, invitationHandler: @escaping (Bool, MCSession?) -> Void) {
        let ac = UIAlertController(title: title, message: "\(peerID.displayName) wants to connect", preferredStyle: .alert)

            ac.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Allow", style: .default, handler: { [weak self] _ in
                invitationHandler(true, self?.mcSession)
            }))

            ac.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Decline", style: .cancel, handler: { _ in
                invitationHandler(false, nil)
            }))

            present(ac, animated: true)
    }
```

5\. In your info.plist file add permissions.  You will need to open as source.  Add this above `<key>UIApplicationSceneManifest</key>`.


```xml
<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Need to send pictures to known phones</string>
    <key>NSBonjourServices</key>
    <array>
        <string>_hws-project25._tcp</string>
        <string>_hws-project25._udp</string>
    </array>
```
