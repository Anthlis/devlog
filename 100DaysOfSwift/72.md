Today I learned how to create a notification, send data with that notification, and get the data when the user taps on that said notification.

## How to get access to send notification

We request authorization, and Apple will use its built-in UIAlertController.  If the user says, the boolean in the callback will be true.  Otherwise, we'll get back an error.

```swift
 @objc func registerLocal() {
        let center = UNUserNotificationCenter.current()
        center.requestAuthorization(options: [.alert, .badge, .sound]) {
            granted, error in
            if granted {
                print("Yay!")
            } else {
                print("D'oh!")
            }
        }
    }
```
