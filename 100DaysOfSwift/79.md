# 100DaysOfSwift Day 79 - 2022-01-29

Today was  challenge day.  I got use a tuple to store all the "magic numbers" for creating the enemy.  I made an different kind of enemy had had to adjust the name and image to that I could make it go slighly faster to score more point.  I also added a game over image to the game while making the enemies on the screen fade out.
