# 100DaysOfSwift Day 77 - 2022-01-27

Today I learned how to create slice actions by create an SKShapeNode that follow UIBezierPath.  I also learned how to play sounds with AVAudioPlayer.  It was a good game logic day.

## Drawing the Slices

First we respond to the touches began event.  This means the user has touched the screen.  We delete all of the active touches we are storing and call redrawActiveSlice which will draw everything up.

```swift
override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) {
        guard let touch = touches.first else { return }
        activeSlicePoints.removeAll(keepingCapacity: true)
        let location = touch.location(in: self)
        activeSlicePoints.append(location)
        redrawActiveSlice()
        
        // This is so the fade out in the touches end does not interfer with
        // the new lines being created
        activeSliceBG.removeAllActions()
        activeSliceFG.removeAllActions()
        
        activeSliceFG.alpha = 1
        activeSliceBG.alpha = 1
    }
```

Then touches moves get calles as the player moves their finger across the screen.  We add points the active slice points array and redraw.  We also start the sound playing if the there is no playing

```swift
override func touchesMoved(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) {
        guard let touch = touches.first else { return }
        let location = touch.location(in: self)
        activeSlicePoints.append(location)
        redrawActiveSlice()
        
        if !isSwooshSoundActive {
            playSwooshSound()
        }
    }
```

Once the play remove their finger we add a fade out action to fade the lines out over 1/4 of second.

```swift
override func touchesEnded(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) {
        activeSliceBG.run(SKAction.fadeOut(withDuration:   0.25))
        activeSliceFG.run(SKAction.fadeOut(withDuration:   0.25))
    }
```

## Drawing the slices

This will draw the slices by creating a path from all points.

```swift
func redrawActiveSlice() {
        if activeSlicePoints.count < 2 {
            activeSliceBG.path = nil
            activeSliceFG.path = nil
            return
        }
        
        if activeSlicePoints.count > 12 {
            activeSlicePoints.removeFirst(activeSlicePoints.count - 12)
        }
        
        let path = UIBezierPath()
        path.move(to: activeSlicePoints[0])
        
        for i in 1..<activeSlicePoints.count {
            path.addLine(to: activeSlicePoints[i])
        }
        
        activeSliceFG.path = path.cgPath
        activeSliceBG.path = path.cgPath
    }
```

## Playing the sounds

We set isSwooshSoundActive to true so that we don't play multiple swoosh sounds
At the end of the action that plays the sound we set isSwooshSoundActive back to false
We have 3 different swoosh sounds that are played at random.

```
func playSwooshSound() {
        isSwooshSoundActive = true
        let randomNumber = Int.random(in: 1...3)
        let soundName = "swoosh\(randomNumber).caf"
        
        let swooshSound = SKAction.playSoundFileNamed(soundName, waitForCompletion: true)
        run(swooshSound) {
            [weak self] in
            self?.isSwooshSoundActive = false
        }
    }
```

## Creating the bombs

First the function can force a bomb or penguin to be created by using ForceBomb enum.

For the bomb we want the fuse to continue to play until their are no bombs on the screen.  We turn off the sound once all the bombs leave in the update functon.



```swift

enum ForcedBomb {
    case never, alway, random
}

func createEnemy(forceBomb: ForcedBomb = .random) {
        let enemy: SKSpriteNode
        
        var enemyType = Int.random(in: 0...6)
        
        if forceBomb == .never {
            enemyType = 1
        } else if forceBomb == .alway {
            enemyType = 0
        }
        
        if enemyType == 0 {
            enemy = SKSpriteNode()
            enemy.zPosition = 1
            enemy.name = "bombContainer"
            
            let bombImage = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "slicedBomb")
            bombImage.name = "bomb"
            enemy.addChild(bombImage)
            
            if bombSoundEffect != nil {
                bombSoundEffect?.stop()
                bombSoundEffect = nil
            }
            
            if let path = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "sliceBombUse", withExtension: "caf") {
                if let sound = try? AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: path) {
                    bombSoundEffect = sound
                    sound.play()
                }
            }
            
            if let emitter = SKEmitterNode(fileNamed: "slicedFuse") {
                emitter.position = CGPoint(x: 76, y: 64)
                enemy.addChild(emitter)
            }
            
        } else {
            enemy = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "penguin")
            run(SKAction.playSoundFileNamed("launch.caf", waitForCompletion: false))
            enemy.name = "enemy"
        }
        
        let randomPosition = CGPoint(x: Int.random(in: 64...960), y: -128)
        enemy.position = randomPosition
        
        let randomAngularVelocity = CGFloat.random(in: -3...3)
        let randomXVelocity: Int
        
        if randomPosition.x < 256 {
            randomXVelocity = Int.random(in: 8...15)
        } else if randomPosition.x < 512 {
            randomXVelocity = Int.random(in: 3...5)
        } else if randomPosition.x < 768 {
            randomXVelocity = -Int.random(in: 3...5)
        } else {
            randomXVelocity = -Int.random(in: 8...15)
        }
        
        let randomYVelocity = Int.random(in: 24...32)
        enemy.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(circleOfRadius: 64)
        enemy.physicsBody?.velocity = CGVector(dx: randomXVelocity * 40, dy: randomYVelocity * 40)
        enemy.physicsBody?.angularVelocity = randomAngularVelocity
        enemy.physicsBody?.collisionBitMask = 0
        
        addChild(enemy)
        activeEnemies.append(enemy)
    }
    
    override func update(_ currentTime: TimeInterval) {
        var bombCount = 0
        for node in activeEnemies {
            if node.name == "bombContainer" {
                bombCount += 1
                break
            }
        }
        
        if bombCount == 0 {
            bombSoundEffect?.stop()
            bombSoundEffect = nil
        }
    }
```
