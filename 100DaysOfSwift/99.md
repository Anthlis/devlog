# 100DaysOfSwift Day 99 - 2022-02-19

Today was a challenge day.  I learned how to make a country-matching flip card game.  I learned how to do a flip card animation and a fade animation.  I also got practice separating the game logic from the UI logic.  It took me about 2 1/2 hours to build.

## Game State

The point of the game is to keep the UI Logic and the game logic separated.  This will make it easier to to write tests and easier to understand.  It also makes it so that we can easly port the logic to another app if we want to as well.  It's a good separation of concerns.

I used typedalias for documentation

```swift


import Foundation

typealias Capital = String
typealias Country = String



struct Card: Equatable {
    var position: Int
    var text: String
    var isMatched: Bool = false
    var showing: Bool = false
}

struct GameState {
    var selectedCard1: Card?
    var pairs : [Capital: Country] = [
        "Paris": "France",
        "Washington D.C.": "United States",
        "Argentina": "Buenos Aires",
        "Berlin": "Germany",
        "Vietnam": "Hanoi",
        "Latvia": "Riga",
        "Kenya": "Nairobi",
        "Ireland": "Dublin"
    ]
    var gameStarted = false
    var cards = [Card]()
    
    
    mutating func move(cardNumber: Int) {
        
        var selectedCard = cards[cardNumber]
        
        guard let firstCard = selectedCard1 else {
            selectedCard1 = selectedCard
            selectedCard.showing = true
            return
        }
    
        
        cards = cards.map {
            var card = Card(position: $0.position, text: $0.text)
            card.isMatched = $0.isMatched
            if ($0 == firstCard || $0 == selectedCard) {
                card.isMatched = isMatch(firstCard: firstCard, secondCard: selectedCard)
            }
            card.showing = false
            return card
        }
        
        selectedCard1 = nil
    }
    
    func isMatch(firstCard: Card, secondCard: Card) -> Bool {
        
        return pairs[firstCard.text] == secondCard.text || pairs[secondCard.text] == firstCard.text
    }
        
    mutating func newGame() {
        var randomPairs: [Capital: Country] = [:]
        
        for (i, pair) in pairs.shuffled().enumerated() {
            if i < 4 {
                randomPairs[pair.key] = pair.value
            }
        }
        
        selectedCard1 = nil
        cards = shuffleCards(countryPairs: randomPairs).enumerated().map {
            return Card(position: $0, text: $1)
        }
    }
    
    var gameOver: Bool {
        return cards.filter { $0.isMatched }.count == cards.count && gameStarted
    }
    
    

    func shuffleCards(countryPairs: [Capital: Country]) -> [String] {
       return  countryPairs.shuffled().reduce([String](), {acc, entry in
           var copy = acc.map { $0 }
           copy.append(entry.value)
           copy.append(entry.key)
           return copy
        }).shuffled()
    }
    
}

```

## ViewController

The view controller uses a didSet on game property to connect the game logic code to the UI code.  You can look at this like the glue between the two.

```swift
var game: GameState! {
        didSet {
            
            if !game.gameStarted {
                return
            }
            
            canMove = true
            if game.selectedCard1 != nil {
                
                return
            }
            
            self.game.cards.forEach { card in
                guard let label = self.cardLabels.first(where: { $0.text == card.text }) else { return }
                if card.isMatched {
                    label.hideCard()
                } else {
                    label.flipCardOver()
                }
            }
            
            
            
            if self.game.gameOver {
                let ac = UIAlertController(title: "You Won", message: nil, preferredStyle: .alert)
                ac.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "YEAH!", style: .default))
                
                present(ac, animated: true)
            }
        }
    }
```

## New Game Method

There is a few things to note.  We are UITapGestureRecognizer to connect the tap event to the label being tapped.  I am using tags to know which label was tapped.

I have the cards flipped by default so that when I un flip them it will show the a white text color and won't look like the text is backwards.

```swift
@objc func newGame() {
        game.gameStarted = false
        game.newGame()
        
        cardLabels.enumerated().forEach {
            $1.isUserInteractionEnabled = true
            $1.addGestureRecognizer(UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(selectedCard)))
            $1.transform = CGAffineTransform(scaleX: -1, y: 1)
            $1.textColor = $1.backgroundColor
            $1.alpha = 1
            $1.text = game.cards[$0].text
        }
        game.gameStarted = true
    }
```

## Move Function

This function responds to when a player selects a card.  Notice we cast the view to a UILabel.  The show card uses closing trail syntax to pass an escaping callback to the showCard function.  This way we can execute what to do next after the animation completes.

```swift
 @objc func selectedCard(sender: UITapGestureRecognizer) {
        
        if !canMove {
            return
        }
        
        canMove = false
        guard let label = sender.view as? UILabel else { return }
        label.showCard() {
            [weak self, weak label] in
            guard let cardNumber = label?.tag else { return }
            self?.game.move(cardNumber: cardNumber - 1)
        }
    }
```

## Animation functions

I use am extension for these so that we can keep them out of the view controller and document more what each of them do.  Notice I am passing a closure into showCard function as described above.

```swift
extension UILabel {
    func showCard(onComplete: @escaping (() -> Void)) {
        UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.5, delay: 0, options: [], animations: {
            self.transform = .identity
            self.textColor = .white
        }, completion: { _ in
            onComplete()
        })
    }
    
    func flipCardOver() {
        UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.5, delay: 0, options: [], animations: {
            self.transform = CGAffineTransform(scaleX: -1, y: 1)
            self.textColor = self.backgroundColor
            self.alpha = 1
        })
    }
    
    func hideCard() {
        UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.5, delay: 0, options: [], animations: {
            self.alpha = 0
        })
    }
}
```
