# 100DaysOfSwift Day 96 - 2022-02-16

Today was a challenge day.   I learned how to create a random gravity in the sprite kit to simulate wind and wind direction. I had to use sin and cos to do that. I practiced communicating between the viewcontroller and the game scene to update the labels and UI.

## Level + End Game Challenge

I had to implement levels each time a player won the round.  I used didSets to set the labels for the UI part.

```swift
var level = 1 {
        didSet {
            levelLabel.text = "Level: \(level)"
        }
    }
    
    var player1Score = 0 {
        didSet {
            player1ScoreLabel.text = "Player 1: \(player1Score)"
        }
    }
    
    var player2Score = 0 {
        didSet {
            player2ScoreLabel.text = "Player 2: \(player2Score)"
        }
    }
```

Then in the destroy function I call nextLevel and winRound on the viewController to update the labels.  I have code here as well to end the game.  It's super messy because the order matters.  

```swift
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 2) {
            
            self.viewController?.winRound(player: self.currentPlayer)
            
            if self.viewController?.level ?? 0 == 3 {
                self.viewController?.gameOver()
                return
            }
            
            // This has to be below the the increment level so we don't
            // trigger the game over all level 3
            self.viewController?.nextLevel()


```

## Wind Speed Challenge

Here I use gravity and a little bit of geometry to determine a random about to add to the gravity of physics world.  

```swift
func newGravity() {
    let degree = Int.random(in: 180...359);
    let radiansRandom = deg2rad(deg: degree)
    let windSpeedDouble = Double(Int.random(in: 1...3))

    physicsWorld.gravity =  CGVector(dx: cos(radiansRandom) * windSpeedDouble, dy: sin(radiansRandom) * windSpeedDouble - 9.81)

    self.viewController?.updateWindLabel(speed: Int(windSpeedDouble * 10), angle: degree)
}
```
