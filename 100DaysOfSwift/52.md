# #100DaysOfSwift Day 52 - 2022-01-01

Today was a review day.  We went over auto layouts, image picker controller, and more.  I struggled with auto layouts, which seems to be a common pain point in iOS development.  I was able to get it to work with some adjusting.  Overall, I feel good, and I am grateful that today was a light day.

## Screenshots of what I did

## Note about the destination

I want to continue to build apps and one day work on iOS at my job.  I am hoping to do that this year.  I know I am not quite ready for that yet, but I am getting there day by day.
