# 100DaysOfSwift Day 67 - 2022-01-16

Today I built a safari extension.  I had to write javascript code that communicates with swift code to do this.  To make the javascript code, the OS passes the javascript code to the swift code. 

## Code

## Swift Code

- extensionContext: This is the object that lets us interact with the js code
- inputItems is what the extension context is sending the swift code
- inputItem has an attachment which is a dictionary of strings
- loadItem will get us an item while the provider is busy loading all the data into swift.
- The do stuff where we actually do stuff.

```
if let inputItem = extensionContext?.inputItems.first as? NSExtensionItem {
            if let itemProvider = inputItem.attachments?.first {
                itemProvider.loadItem(forTypeIdentifier: kUTTypeIdentifierKey as String) {
                    [weak self] (dict, error) in
                    // do stuff
                }
            }
        }
```

## JS Code

There are two functions run and finalized.  Runs goes first then finalize.

```js
var Action = function() {}

Action.prototype = {
    
    run: function(parameters) {
        
    },
        
    finalize: function(parameters) {
        
    }
};

var ExtensionPreprocessingJS = new Action;

```
