# 100DaysOfSwift Day 63 - 2022-01-12

Today I met with my mentor, and I worked on an iOS project where we made the pins turn purple after a user had seen the pins for the first time.  It was amazing.  We also talked about career advice and other beneficial things.  He feels that I need apps that look great on the app store before I am able to transition to being a professional iOS developer. It's great to have someone to talk to about this.  I also did the challenge project in Swift.

## How we made the map view change color

First, we changed the logic on our annotation to set a property called hasBeenSeen to true.  We added a visible property.  We know if the visible property goes from false to true, then the user has seen the map pin.  

```swift
class Capital: NSObject, MKAnnotation {
    ...
    var hasBeenSeen: Bool = false
    var isVisible = false {
        didSet {
            if oldValue == true && isVisible == false {
                hasBeenSeen = true
                print("changing has been seen \(title) \(hasBeenSeen)")
            }
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

Then in the view controller, we added a function that runs every time the map moves.  We loop through all the annotations on the map set the visible property, which will trigger the logic above.  We only add and remove the pins if they are not the right color.

```swift
func mapViewDidChangeVisibleRegion(_ mapView: MKMapView) {
//        print("\(#function)")
        mapView.annotations.forEach { annotation in
            guard let capital = annotation as? Capital else { return  }
            capital.isVisible = mapView.visibleMapRect.contains(MKMapPoint.init(capital.coordinate))

            if let view = mapView.view(for: annotation) as? MKPinAnnotationView {
                if capital.hasBeenSeen && view.pinTintColor == .systemOrange {
                    mapView.removeAnnotation(capital)
                    mapView.addAnnotation(capital)
                } else if !capital.hasBeenSeen && view.pinTintColor == .systemPurple {
                    mapView.removeAnnotation(capital)
                    mapView.addAnnotation(capital)
                }
            }
            
        }
        
    }
```

After that, we modified the mapView function that controls how the pin gets drawn on the map.  We use annotation/capital to draw it orange or purple.

```swift
func mapView(_ mapView: MKMapView, viewFor annotation: MKAnnotation) -> MKAnnotationView? {
        guard let captial = annotation as? Capital else { return nil }
        
        let identifier = "Capital"
        if let annotationView = mapView.dequeueReusableAnnotationView(withIdentifier: identifier) as? MKPinAnnotationView {
            annotationView.annotation = annotation
           // here is where we use the captial
            annotationView.pinTintColor = captial.hasBeenSeen ? .systemPurple : .systemOrange
            return annotationView

        } else {
            let annotationView = MKPinAnnotationView(annotation: captial, reuseIdentifier: identifier)
            annotationView.canShowCallout = true
            let btn = UIButton(type: .detailDisclosure)
            // here is where we use the captial
            annotationView.pinTintColor = captial.hasBeenSeen ? .systemPurple : .systemOrange
            annotationView.rightCalloutAccessoryView = btn
            return annotationView
        }
    }
```
## How to stop the user from cheating

I used a property called can move that I set to true on touchesBegan.  I then allow movement as long as canMove is true.

```swift

   canMove = false

   override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) {
        guard let touch = touches.first else { return }
        
        let location = touch.location(in: self)

        canMove = player.contains(location)
    }
    
    override func touchesMoved(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) {
        
        if !canMove {
            return
        }
        
   }
```

## How to make the timer time shrink every 20 enemies

I used a didSet on the enemy count to make sure it shrinks after every 20 enemies.  I the create enemy function, I add one to the enemyCount, which is why the didSet triggers.


```swift
var enemyTime = 0.9
    
    var enemyCount = 0 {
        didSet {
            if enemyCount % 20 == 0 && enemyCount > 0 {
                enemyTime -= 0.1
                gameTimer?.invalidate()
                gameTimer = Timer.scheduledTimer(timeInterval: enemyTime, target: self, selector: #selector(createEnemy), userInfo: nil, repeats: true)

            }
        }
    }
```


## How make the enemies stop create

I add another didSet on isGameOver that stops the timer from creating enemies.

```swift
 var isGameOver = false {
        didSet {
            gameTimer?.invalidate()
        }
    }
```
