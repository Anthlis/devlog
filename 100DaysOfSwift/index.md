# #100DaysOfSwift

My iOS mentor suggested that I go through [100DaysOfSwift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/).  This is my journery through it.  I started recording notes at day 49.  If you have any questions feel free to email me glaserpower [@] gmail.com.

## Skipping App Extension Lessons

For now I recommend skipping the app extension lessons.  They do not work on iOS 15 and probably do not work on iOS 14.  These lessons are from 67 through 69. 

I felt the big thing I missed was messing with the notification center.  I think will try doing that for my day 69.
