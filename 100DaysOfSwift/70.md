# 100DaysOfSwift Day 70 - 2022-01-19

Today I built a game with Paul using spritekit.  I got to practice adding sprites into sprites, colorBlendMode, creating sprites that follow a pattern, and much more.  I also learned a new for looping in swift that only loops around a specific case.

## Sprites following a curve

First we create a path with a line in it.

### SKAction.follow

This action causes the sprite the follow the path

- orientToPath will make sure the sprite is always pointed towards the path
- asOffset starts sprite 
- speed: is the speed it will go. It will take as long as it takes
- path.cgPath converts it into a core graphic path so that all iOS devices can use it.

```swift
        let path = UIBezierPath()
        path.move(to: .zero) // means start at the beginning of the path
        path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: xMovement, y: 1000)) 
        let move = SKAction.follow(path.cgPath, asOffset: true, orientToPath: true, speed: 200)
        node.run(move)

```


## Sprite with color blend mode

The color property is what sets the color of the sprite.

The colorBlendMode property controls how much of the color will be used in the sprite.  Because we are using 1, it will be 100% of the color.

```swift

let firework = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "rocket")
        firework.colorBlendFactor = 1
        firework.name = "firework"
        node.addChild(firework)
        
        switch Int.random(in: 0...2) {
            case 0:
                firework.color = .cyan
            case 1:
                firework.color = .green
            default:
                firework.color = .red
        }
```

## For case let loop

This is special for loop that will filter out all non SKSpriteNodes.  Pretty cool!

```
for case let node as SKSpriteNode in nodesAtPoint {

}
```
