# 100DaysOfSwift Day 64 - 2022-02-13

Today we started building a clone of an old DOS game where gorillas throw bananas at buildings.  I learned how to use a stride for a loop.  I also got more practice with Core Graphics.  I also learned how to create HSV color values in Swift.

## Drawing Building

We have one function for drawing the function, called drawBuilding which takes a CGSize.  We use UIGraphicsImageRender to produce the UIIMage for the texture of the building.

1\. Draw the rectangle for the building.  Make it have random colors.

```swift
            let rectangle = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: size.width, height: size.height)
            let color: UIColor
            
            switch Int.random(in: 0...2) {
                case 0:
                color = UIColor(hue: 0.502, saturation: 0.98, brightness: 0.67, alpha: 1)
            case 1:
                color = UIColor(hue: 0.999, saturation: 0.99, brightness: 0.67, alpha: 1)
            default:
                color = UIColor(hue: 0, saturation: 0, brightness: 0.67, alpha: 1)
            }
            
            color.setFill()
            ctx.cgContext.addRect(rectangle)
            ctx.cgContext.drawPath(using: .fill)

```

2\. Draw the windows, making them randonly look like the lights are on or off.

Stride is a fancy way of creating a for loop. 

```swift
 color.setFill()
            ctx.cgContext.addRect(rectangle)
            ctx.cgContext.drawPath(using: .fill)
            
            let lightOnColor = UIColor(hue: 0.19, saturation: 0.67, brightness: 0.99, alpha: 1)
            let lightOffColor = UIColor(hue: 0, saturation: 0, brightness: 0.34, alpha: 1)
            
            
            for row in stride(from: 10, to: Int(size.height - 10), by: 40) {
                for col in stride(from: 10, to: Int(size.width - 10), by: 40) {
                    if Bool.random() {
                        lightOnColor.setFill()
                    } else{
                        lightOffColor.setFill()
                    }
                    ctx.cgContext.fill(CGRect(x: col, y: row, width: 15, height: 20))
                }
            }
```

## Connecting the view controller with the game scene

This is done by having a weak reference variable on the game scene.  It's weak so that if the game scene ever gets deleted the garbage collection can clean it up.

```swift
    weak var viewController: GameViewController?
```

In the view controller we assign the properties to gamesceen and view controller.  This happens in the viewDidLoad function.

```swift
                currentGame = scene as? GameScene
                currentGame?.viewController = self

```
