# 100DaysOfSwift Day 98 - 2022-02-16

Today was a challenge day.  The biggest I learned is to always use instruments before deploying an app.  I also learned how to load and resize UI Images using core graphics.  It was necessary because the app was loading huge images.  I also learned how to spot strong reference cycles using instruments as well.  These are bad because they are memory links that cause apps to slow down.

## Code

### Resizing images

The coolest thing here is the UIImage extension which I copied from stackoverflow.  I also got to practice a lot of closures using the filter function.


```swift
import Foundation
import UIKit

var images: [String: UIImage] = [:]

func loadImage() {
    let filemanager = FileManager.default

    do {
        
        
        let fileNames = try filemanager.contentsOfDirectory(atPath: Bundle.main.resourceURL?.path ?? "" + "/Supporting Files/Content").filter { $0.contains(".jpg")  && $0.contains("Thumb")  && !$0.contains("@") }
            .map({ $0.replacingOccurrences(of: ".jpg", with: "")})

        for fileName in fileNames {
            guard let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: fileName, ofType: "jpg") else { continue }
            
            if let image = UIImage(contentsOfFile: path) {
                images[fileName] = image.resized(to: CGSize(width: 300, height: 300))
            }
        }
    } catch {
        print(error)
        
    }
}

func getImage(fileName: String) -> UIImage? {
    return images[fileName]
}

func getDocumentsDirectory() -> URL {
    let paths = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)
    return paths[0]
}

extension UIImage {
    func resized(to size: CGSize) -> UIImage {
        return UIGraphicsImageRenderer(size: size).image { _ in
            draw(in: CGRect(origin: .zero, size: size))
        }
    }
}
```

### In practice

```swift
        guard let original = getImage(fileName: image) else { fatalError("No Image Found!")}
```
