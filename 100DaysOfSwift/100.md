# 100DaysOfSwift Day 100 - 2022-02-20

Today was day 100 and the last day of hacking with swift.  It's been an amazing journey and I feel like I have learned a ton.  I am grateful to Paul for making all these videos and teaching me iOS.  I feel more ready to build my own apps and to one have a job in the iOS.  I had no idea how deep the rabbit hole went.  

## What I have learn

- Consistency is the king, slow and steady win the race.
- Go easy on myself if I miss a day, just get back on track.
- Coding is like learning to play the piano, you have to practice a lot to get anywhere with it.
