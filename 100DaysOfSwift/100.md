# 100DaysOfSwift Day 100 - 2022-02-20

Today was day 100 and the last day of 100 Days of Swift. I took and passed the final exam with an 88 grade. It's been a fantastic journey, and I feel like I have learned a ton. I am grateful to Paul for making all these videos and teaching me iOS. I feel more ready to build my own apps and have a job in iOS. I had no idea how deep the rabbit hole went.  I spent about an hour to 3 hours a day on it.   It was definitely worth it!!  

## What I have learn

- Consistency is the king, slow and steady win the race.
- Go easy on myself if I miss a day, just get back on track.
- Coding is like learning to play the piano, you have to practice a lot to get anywhere with it.
