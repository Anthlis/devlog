## Hacking with Swift Day 54

Today I learned go to practice what my iOS mentor talked about.  Having one variable that contains all the state and then setting a didSet on it so that when something changes all the changes happen in one place.  I also got to practice more core image filter stuff.  I was really happy with the way everything turned out.

## Laravel

I did work on permission system today at work.  I was not able to do any studying because I got a little loaded at work.

## ElectroBlocks

I did not get to this again.  I am going to do this in the morning from now on. 

## Personal Note

My boss quit the job today.  I was not happy about it, but I was happy for him.  He made the best decision I feel for his family and his life.  I know I am going to have to pick up the slack.  This will mean learning Laravel at a much deeper level and learning PostGIS.  I bought PostGIS in action.  

Bottom line is that I need to study in morning and divide and conquer.  He was such a core part of the team that we will need to divide up the work.  I will also be getting advice from my mentors.  It's important to keep a cool head and move forward.
