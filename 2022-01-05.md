## 100 Days of Swift 55

Today I finished the game project.  

### How to run a sequence of actions

```swift
        let delay = SKAction.wait(forDuration: 0.25)
        let hide = SKAction.moveBy(x: 0, y: -80, duration: 0.5)
        let notVisible = SKAction.run { [weak self] in self?.isVisible = false}
        let showMud = SKAction.run {
            [weak self] in
            self?.showMud()
        }
        let sequence = SKAction.sequence([delay, showMud, hide, notVisible])
```

### How to add a particle effect and remove it after 1/2 second

```swift
if let smokeEmitter = SKEmitterNode(fileNamed: "smoke") {
                smokeEmitter.zPosition = 2
                smokeEmitter.position = location
                addChild(smokeEmitter)
                DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1) {
                    smokeEmitter.removeFromParent()
                }
            }
```

### How to go up the node tree

In this case, we had our custom node WhackNode, and we wanted to see if the penguin was hit.  We are looking to see if it was the penguin we know will always be in WhackNode.  We make sure we deal with the whacknode by typecasting the parent's parent.

```html
<whacknode>
  <charnode>
    <pegquin_node />
  </charnode>
</whacknode>
```

To do that in swift you do this:

```swift
// because this code is in a loop, we use to continue, but most of the time, I use return.
guard let whackSlot = node.parent?.parent as? WhackSlot else { continue }
```
Then you can check the node's name that was hit to see if it's a good penguin or a bad one.


## PostGIS In Action

Today I only got through a few pages.  I learned a lot more about postgres than I did about postgis which is great.

- I learned serial means auto increment
- I learned that gist in general is the preferred index for spatial indexes
- I learend how to add a foreign key in postgres

I only got through 5 pages in 20 minutes but that's ok.  All things worth while take time.  Even 5 pages a day means that I will get through the book in a 112 which is not bad!!

```sql

-- create an populate the table lu_franchises

create table ch01.lu_franchises (id char(3) primary key, franchise varchar(30));

insert into ch01.lu_franchises (id, franchise) VALUES
('BKG', 'Burger King'), ('CJR', 'Carl''s Jr'),
('HDE', 'Hardee'), ('INO', 'In-N-Out'),
('JIB', 'Jack in the Box'), ('KFC', 'Kentucky Fried Chicken'),
('MCD', 'McDonald'), ('PZH', 'Pizza Hut'),
('TCB', 'Taco Bell'), ('WDY', 'Wendys');


-- create an populate the table restaurants
-- In postgres serial is the same as auto increment
create table ch01.restaurants (
id serial primary key, 
franchise char(3) not null,
geom geometry(point, 2163) -- This second is the SRID which identifies the type of map
)

-- This adds a spatial index to queries to make them faster
-- There are three kinds of spatial index but gist is usually the one you want to use.

create index ix_code_restuarant_geom on ch01.restaurants  using gist(geom);

-- Creates a foriegn key constraint

alter table ch01.restaurants 
add constraint fk_restuarant_lu_franchises
foreign key (franchise)
references ch01.lu_franchises (id)
on update cascade on delete restrict;

-- puts an index on the foriegn key

create index fi_restaurant_franchise on ch01.restaurants  (franchise)

-- creates the highway table
-- varying is the same as varchar
-- 
create table ch01.highways (
gid integer not null,
feature character varying(80),
name character varying(120),
state character varying(2),
geom geometry (multilinestring, 2163), -- notice we are using multi lines and not points
constraint pk_highways primary key (gid)
)

-- puts the index on the multi line string
create index ix_highways on ch01.highways using gist(geom);
```
