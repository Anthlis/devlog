## 100DaysOfSwift Day 58

Today I got practice animations with swift.  It was fun the challenging part was remembering how to reset all the images and everything back.

I did things the hard way in code but the better way is to use .identity.  That will reset it back.

```swift
button.transform = .identity
```

## Laravel Day 8

Today the course went over styling which was good to know.  It was a review of the bootstrap classes.   It then went over testing.

### Carbon Methods

I also reviewed some useful carbon methods.  Carbon is a datetime library for php.

```php

// returns the diff in minutes
now()->diffInMinutes($post->created_at)

// returns the nicely printed diff for people
$post->created_at->diffForHumans()
```

### How to use a test in memory database with laravel

1\. In your config/database.php, add a new connection. The :memory will make Laravel create the database in memory.

```php 
'sqlite_testing' => [
            'driver' => 'sqlite',
            'database' => ":memory",
        ],
`` 

2\. Then use the connection in your phpunit.xml file.

```xml
<php>
        ...
        <server name="DB_CONNECTION" value="sqlite_testing" />
    </php>
```

## PostGiS in Action Day 3

This was another brutal day for PostGIS.  It took me forever, but I figured how to import shp / shapefile into the database.  I have to use a program called QGIS.  The learning curve is intense, but I am getting it.  I figured out adding a connection and importing the table into the database.  This would make a great tutorial, lol!
