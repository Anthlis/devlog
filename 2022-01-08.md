## 100 Days of Swift Day 59

Today was a challenge day where I had to build an app that displayed a list of countries.  When you click on the country, it will then show the details of that country.

### API Used

I learned a ton of stuff from today's challenge.

### How to make a function to call any endpoint

- T: Codable allows you to pass in the type of the function and allows it to be parsed as JSON
- after callback allows you to not do the work inside the function, which means that it can be used universally
  - You must do all UI work on the main thread, so if using this, be sure to use DispatchQueue.main.async 
- This will catch all the JSON errors which are great when you building codable structs and you want to get everything right

```swift
func getData<T: Codable>(url: URL, type: T.Type, after: (T) -> Void) {
        do {
            let data = try  Data(contentsOf: url)
            let jsonDecoder = JSONDecoder()
            let json = try jsonDecoder.decode(type, from: data)
            // This is for the callback
            after(json)
        } catch let DecodingError.dataCorrupted(context) {
            print(context)
        } catch let DecodingError.keyNotFound(key, context) {
            print("Key '\(key)' not found:", context.debugDescription)
            print("codingPath:", context.codingPath)
        } catch let DecodingError.valueNotFound(value, context) {
            print("Value '\(value)' not found:", context.debugDescription)
            print("codingPath:", context.codingPath)
        } catch let DecodingError.typeMismatch(type, context)  {
            print("Type '\(type)' mismatch:", context.debugDescription)
            print("codingPath:", context.codingPath)
        } catch {
            print("error: ", error)
        }
    }
```
### How to have a tableview in a regular view controller

1\. Make it inherit from UITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSource
2\. In the viewDidLoad, set the delegate and datasource to self
3\. Implement the standard table view functions

```swift
class DetailViewController: UIViewController, UITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSource {

    var country: Country?
    @IBOutlet var tableView: UITableView!
    @IBOutlet var imageView: UIImageView!
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        tableView.dataSource = self
        tableView.delegate = self
    }
    
    func numberOfSections(in tableView: UITableView) -> Int {
        return 1
    }
    
    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
        return country?.rows.count ?? 0
    }
    
    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
        if let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "detail")  {
            cell.textLabel?.text = country?.rows[indexPath.row].title
            cell.detailTextLabel?.text = country?.rows[indexPath.row].subtitle
            return cell
        }
        
        fatalError("Missing Cell")
    }
}

```


### How to deal with inconsistent data in an api response

Sometimes languages and other properties for the countries were not there.  My way of dealing with it was making it nullable.  

Then I would check that it's there in computed variable rows.  The rows variable is used to display the rows on the detailed page.  This is good practice because most APIs are not consistent.

```swift
struct CountryName: Codable {
    let common: String;
    let official: String;
}

struct Country: Codable {
    let name: CountryName
    let population: Double
    let flags: Flags
    let languages: [String: String]?
    let currencies: [String: Currency]?
    
    var rows: [(title: String, subtitle: String)] {
        var rows: [(title: String, subtitle: String)] = [
            (title: "Population", subtitle: Int(population).withCommas()),
        ]
        
        if let languages = self.languages {
            rows.append((title: "Languages", subtitle: languages.enumerated().map{ $0.element.value   }.joined(separator: ", ")))
        }
        
        if let currencies = self.currencies {
            if let currencyName = currencies.first?.value.name {
                rows.append((title: "Currency Name", subtitle: currencyName))
            }

            if let currencySymbol = currencies.first?.value.symbol {
                rows.append((title: "Currency Symbol", subtitle: currencySymbol))
            }
        }
       
        
        
        return rows
    }
}

struct Currency: Codable {
    let name: String?
    let symbol: String?
}

struct Flags: Codable {
    let png: String
    let svg: String
}

extension Int {
    func withCommas() -> String {
        let numberFormatter = NumberFormatter()
        numberFormatter.numberStyle = .decimal
        return numberFormatter.string(from: NSNumber(value:self))!
    }
}

```

## Laravel Day 9

Today was a quick laravel day.  I learned how to run tests with laravel sails


```bash
sail test
```

I wanted to write down the basic framework for writing all tests.

- Arrange -> Setup
- Act -> Doing something
- Assert -> Verifying that everything is good

Example

```php
public function testSee1BlogPostWhenThereIs1()
    {
        // Arrange
        $post = new BlogPost();
        $post->title = "New Title";
        $post->content = "Hello World";
        $post->save();

        // Act
        $response = $this->get('/posts');

        // Assert
        $response->assertSeeText('New Title');

        $this->assertDatabaseHas('blog_posts', [
            'title' => 'New Title',
        ]);
    }
}
```

I also learned a new assert in Laravel.  The first argument is the table name and the second on is an array that creates the where clause.

```php
$this->assertDatabaseHas('blog_posts', [
            'title' => 'New Title',
        ]);
```

## ElectroBlocks Day 3

I got a lot of feedback on my streaming rainbow video from my partner.  I realized that I needed only one slide to explain how we moved the data in the array.  He was very generous with his time, and I am grateful for that!

## PostGIS In Action Day 4

Today was a short day for PostGIS.  I learned/reviewed a few queries.  I was able to get all the data into the "productions" tables.  I then ran a query in the book. 

A few notes about this query

- We have to use distinct because a restaurant might intersect at two roads
- We are joining on distance with the ST_DWithing.  This means that if the restaurant or road geometry is within 1609 meters, consider it hit.
- The rest of this is standard SQL

So what is remarkable about this is that we can say if polygon A and polygon B are within x meters of each other join on it.  We could also do a where clause as well.  This is stupidly powerful!

```sql
SELECT f.franchise
 , COUNT(DISTINCT r.id) As total
FROM ch01.restaurants As r
  INNER JOIN ch01.lu_franchises As f ON r.franchise = f.id
INNER JOIN ch01.highways As h
      ON ST_DWithin(r.geom, h.geom, 1609)
GROUP BY f.franchise
ORDER BY total DESC;
```
