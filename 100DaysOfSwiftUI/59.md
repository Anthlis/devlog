# Day 59 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI - 2022-07-20

Today was challenge day.  I figured out how to store, and dynamically change the filters with core data and got practice with enums that contain values.  I also learned about the onChange modifier.

## Dynamically Change Filters

- You have to create sub view with the list filter
- In the init change the _ version of your variable that contains the filter


```swift
struct ShoeListView: View {
    
    
    @FetchRequest(sortDescriptors: []) var shoes: FetchedResults<Shoe>
    var brandFilter: BrandPredicate
    
    
    init (brandFilter: BrandPredicate, sortBy: [SortDescriptor<Shoe>]) {
        self.brandFilter = brandFilter
        let (predicateString, brand) = getBrand()
        _shoes = FetchRequest(sortDescriptors: sortBy, predicate: NSPredicate(format: predicateString, brand))
    }
    
  ///...
}
```

## Enums with Values

I finally understand how to use this.  Super powerful!

```swift
    func getBrand() -> (String, String) {
        
        switch self.brandFilter {
        case .beginsWith(name: let name):
            return ("brand beginsWith %@", name)
    
        case .contains(name: let name):
            return ("brand contains %@", name)
        }
    }
```

## onChange

This is used in place of didSet with SwiftUI.  I responds to changes on a state variable

```swift 
.onChange(of: brand, perform: {
                brand in
                switch(filter) {
                case .contains:
                    filter = .contains(name: brand)
                case .beginsWith:
                    filter = .beginsWith(name: brand)
                }
            })
```
