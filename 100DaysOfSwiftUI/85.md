# Day 85 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI

Today was a challenge day.  I learned that I want my Swift Views to catch errors and for everything else to throw errors.  I learned that in the challenge when I was saving the file.  I also got good practice with Hstack and Spacer, which is how I got the Image to one side.  I also got training with sorting and confirmation dialog boxes and even more practice with leading and trailing concepts in swift UI.  Overall it was a good day.

## Throwing Errors

Notice how the Prospsects and FileManger throw erros and how ProspectView catches them and shows an alert.

## Spacer with HStack

```swift
    HStack {
        VStack(alignment: .leading) {
            Text(prospect.name)
                .font(.headline)
            Text(prospect.emailAddress)
                .foregroundColor(.secondary)
        }
        Spacer()
        if filter == .none {

            if prospect.isContacted {
                    Image(systemName: "person.crop.circle.fill.badge.checkmark")
                    .foregroundColor(.green)
                } else {
                    Image(systemName: "person.crop.circle.badge.xmark")
                        .foregroundColor(.blue)
                }
            }

    }
```

## Sorting

1. I created an enum with all the sorting types
2. I have a @State variable that controls when the confirmation dialog box is shown
3. Once the sortOption variable changes the body re renders
4. In the computed variable function for filteredAndSorted I sort prospects
