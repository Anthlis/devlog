# Day 85 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI

Today was a challenge day.  I learned that I want my Swift Views to catch errors and for everything else to throw errors.  I learned that in the challenge when I was saving the file.  I also got good practice with Hstack and Spacer, which is how I got the Image to one side.  I also got training with sorting and confirmation dialog boxes and even more practice with leading and trailing concepts in swift UI.  Overall it was a good day.

## Throwing Errors

Notice how the Prospsects and FileManger throw erros and how ProspectView catches them and shows an alert.
