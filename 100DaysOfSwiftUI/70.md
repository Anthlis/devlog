# Day 70 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI - 2022-08-13

We went through the flow of adding a button that sits on top of a map view that adds to an array of Locations.

## Flow

There array of locations determines what displayed on the map via MapAnnonations.  


```swift
    @State private var locations = [Location]()
    @State private var selectedPlace: Location?
    
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            Map(coordinateRegion: $mapRegion, annotationItems: locations) { location in
                MapAnnotation(coordinate: location.coordinate) {
                    VStack {
                        Image(systemName: "star.circle")
                            .resizable()
                            .foregroundColor(.red)
                            .frame(width: 44, height: 44)
                            .background(.white)
                            .clipShape(Circle())
                            .onTapGesture {
                                selectedPlace = location
                            }
                        Text(location.name)
                            .fixedSize()
                    }
                }
            }
        }
   }
```

When you click on the annonation the sheet is display.  You can see that sheet modifier and the onTapGesture above. When we create the EditView we pass in a callback to save the new location

```swift
.sheet(item: $selectedPlace) { place in
            EditView(location: place) { newLocation in
                if let index = locations.firstIndex(of: place) {
                    locations[index] = newLocation
                }
            }
        }
```




We switch the ids to that Location is redrawn.  This switching is done in the EditView.

```swift
 Button("Save") {                       
  var newLocation = location
  newLocation.name = name
  newLocation.description = description
  newLocation.id = UUID()
  onSave(newLocation)
  dismiss()
}
``
