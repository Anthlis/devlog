# Day 67 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI - 2022-08-09

Today was a challenge day.  I learned you need to use a CIVector when creating a Twirl Distortion.  Everything was a basic review.  Overall this was a fun challenge.

## Twirl Distortion

```swift
if inputKeys.contains(kCIInputCenterKey) {
    currentFilter.setValue(CIVector(x:1000, y:1000), forKey: kCIInputCenterKey)
}
```
