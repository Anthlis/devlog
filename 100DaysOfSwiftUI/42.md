# Day 42 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI - 2022-06-11

Today was a challenge day.  The main challenge was toggling between a list view and LazyVGrid.  The other challenges involved an optional date with an if let and breaking up views.

## Toggling Between List and LazyVGrid

The key for me was to wrap everything in a ZStack.  That was I could keep all the navigation title code the same.  I also isolated the ForEach into it's own view so that I did not duplicate a lot of code.

```swift
ZStack {
      if (isGrid) {
          ScrollView {
              LazyVGrid(columns: columns) {
                  MissionListView(missions: missions, astronauts: astronauts)
              }.padding([.horizontal, .vertical])
          }
      } else {
          List {
              MissionListView(missions: missions, astronauts: astronauts)
          }
      }
}.navigationTitle("Moonshot")
                .background(.darkBackground)
                .preferredColorScheme(.dark)
                .toolbar {
                    ToolbarItem {
                        Button("\(isGrid ? "List" : "Grid")") {
                            isGrid.toggle()
                        }
                    }
                }
```

## Optional Date

```swift
 if let launchDate = mission.launchDate {
    Text(launchDate.formatted(date:.abbreviated, time: .omitted))
        .padding()
}

```
