# Day 49 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI

Today I learned about making classes with @Published conform to codable,

## Classes with @Published conform to codable

- CodingKey are the keys / properties we want to save in the class
- required means that sub classes must over ride the function
- The init decodes the data into an object
- encode will encode it
- It does not care what the format is per say, it could be JSON, XML, or YAML

```swift
class User: ObservableObject, Codable {
    enum CodingKeys: CodingKey {
        case name
    }
    
    @Published var name = "Paul Hudson"
    
    
    required init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        
        name = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .name)
    }
    
    func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {
        var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        try container.encode(name, forKey: .name)
    }
    
}
```
