# Day 82 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI

Today was a good review day. I reviewed Tabviews, and environment variables, aka global state, and got some practice filtering with a computed variable.

## Tab View

- The label controls the system image that is shown and view

```swift
    var body: some View {
        TabView {
            ProspectView(filter: .none)
                .tabItem {
                    Label("EveryOne", systemImage: "person.3")
                }
            ProspectView(filter: .contacted)
                .tabItem {
                    Label("Contacted", systemImage: "checkmark.circle")
                }
            ProspectView(filter: .uncontacted)
                .tabItem {
                    Label("Uncontacted", systemImage: "questionmark.diamond")
                }
            MeView()
                .tabItem {
                    Label("Me", systemImage: "person.crop.square")
                }
        }.environmentObject(prospects)
    }
```

## Environment Variables

- The MainActor wrapper is used so all updates happen on the UI thread so the app does not crash.
- This is then used in a StateObject in the content view and then passed into the other views and environment variable.

### ChildViews
```swift
struct ProspectView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var prospects: Prospects

```

### Main Actor

```swift
@MainActor class Prospects: ObservableObject {
    @Published var people: [Prospect]
    
    init() {
        people = [Prospect]()
    }
}
```


## Computed Variable

Based on the filter type passed in this will filter the object

```swift
    var filteredProspects: [Prospect] {
        switch filter {
        case .none:
            return prospects.people
        case .contacted:
            return prospects.people.filter{ $0.isContacted}
        case .uncontacted:
            return prospects.people.filter { !$0.isContacted }
        }
    }
