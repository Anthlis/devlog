## Arrays

- They have types meaning if you create an array of numbers you can only put numbers in the array.
- You make them as big and as small has you want
- .count shows many things are in the array
- .contains("") show if the array has an item
- .remove(at: 3) will remove the 4 item in the array
- To acccess items in the array you can square brackets groceries[4]

```swift
// Createing arrays
var scores = Array<Int>()
var altScores = [Int]()

var beatles = ["John", "Paul", "George", "Ringo"]
var numbers = [4, 8, 16, 23, 42]
var temperatures = [25.3, 28.2, 26.2]

var albums = Array<String>()
albums.append("Folklore")
albums.append("Fearless")
albums.append("Red")

print(albums.count)

albums.remove(at: 2)

var characters = ["Lana", "Pam", "Ray", "Sterling"]
print(characters.count)
characters.remove(at: 3)
```

## Dictonaries

Store key value pairs.  The keys and the values can be any datatype.  You can also provide a default type as well.

```swift
let employees = [
    "name": "Taylor Swift",
    "job" : "Singer",
    "location": "Nashville"
]

print(employees["name", default: "Unknown"])
print(employees["status", default: "Unknown"])

let olympics = [
    2012: "London",
    2016: "Rio de Janeiro"
]

print(olympics[2012, default: "Somewhere"])

```

## Sets

Sets are like arrays.  They store a list of items.  All items in a set must be unique and sets do not care about the order.

```swift
// order does not matter
let actors = Set([
    "Denzel Washington",
    "Tom Cruise",
    "Nicholas Cage",
    "Samuel L Jackson"
])

print(actors)

var peeps = Set<String>()
peeps.insert("Ham")
peeps.insert("Sam")

```

## Enums

Enums store a fixed list of known values.  They are good for storing fixed things like days of the week.

```swift
enum Weekday {
//    case monday
//    case tuesday
//    case wednesday
//    case thursday
//    case friday
    case monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday
}

var day = Weekday.monday
day = .tuesday

print(day)
day = .thursday
```
