# Day 28 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI - 2022-05-16

Today I got to practice with sections, created a computed Date variable to calculate the recommended bedtime automatically, and I created another calculated variable to calculate the items to pick from for hours.

## Sections

Notice the section's init takes in the title string for the section as the first argument.

```swift
Section("When do you want to wake up?") {
                    DatePicker("Please enter a time", selection: $wakeUp, displayedComponents: .hourAndMinute)
                        .labelsHidden()
                }
```

## Sleep Amount Options

I could figure out a better way to do it than a while loop.  

```swift
var sleepAmountOptions: [Double] {
    var options = [Double]()
    var currentOption: Double = 4.0
    while currentOption <= 12.0 {
        options.append(currentOption)
        currentOption += 0.25
    }

    return options
}
```

## Calculate Bedtime

This should still show the alert the if it errors.  I cheated and used the static property if it does error.

```swift
private var suggestedBedTime: Date {
        do {
            let config = MLModelConfiguration()
            let model = try SleepCalculator(configuration: config)
            
            let components = Calendar.current.dateComponents([.hour, .minute], from: wakeUp)
            let hour = (components.hour ?? 0) * 60 * 60
            let minutes = (components.minute ?? 0) * 60
            
            let predicton = try model.prediction(wake: Double(hour + minutes), estimatedSleep: sleepAmount, coffee: Double(coffeeAmount))
            
            return wakeUp - predicton.actualSleep
            
        } catch  {
            alertTitle = "Error"
            alertMessage = "Sorry there was a problem calculating your bed time"
            showAlert = true
        }
   
       return Self.defaultWakeTime
    }
```
