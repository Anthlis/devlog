# Day 75 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI - 2022-08-18

Day 75 of 100DaysSwiftUI. Today we went over how easy it is to add accessibility to iOS apps. It was mostly a review of yesterday. I will add labels and UI hints and test my apps with voiceover.

There is no video today because it's hard to use voiceover with the simulator.  I am not sure if it's possible.
