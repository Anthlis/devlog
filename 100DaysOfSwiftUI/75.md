# Day 75 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI - 2022-08-18

Today we went over how easy it is to add accessiblity to iOS apps.  It was mostly review of yesterday.  I am defintely going to be adding labels and ui hints and testing out my apps with voiceover.  

There is no video today because it's hard to use voiceover with the simulator.  I am not sure if it's possible.
