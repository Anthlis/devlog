# Day 25 - 100DaysOfSwiftUI - 2022-05-13

Today I got practice building an app from scratch.  I got to practice reactive variables, creating alerts, and practicing with closures and tuples.  I feel this took about an hour and 1 1/2 to build.

## Reactive Variables / @State Variable

Here I used showFinalScore and showWrongAnswer to toggele alerts

```swift
    
    @State var showFinalScore = false
    
    @State var showWrongAnswer = false

     func nextMove(_ playerMove: Move) {
        // ...
        if playerMove == winningPick.player {
            score += 1
        } else {
            score -= 1
            showWrongAnswer = true
        }
    
        
        questionAnswered += 1
        computerMove = Move.allCases.randomElement() ?? Move.scissors
        movePicked = PlayerChoice.allCases.randomElement() ?? PlayerChoice.winner
        
        if questionAnswered == 10 {
            showFinalScore = true
        }
        
    }

//...
      .alert("Final Score", isPresented: $showFinalScore, actions: {
          Button("Play Again") {
              questionAnswered = 0
              score = 0
          }
      }, message: {
         Text("You scored: \(score)")
      }).alert("Wrong Answer", isPresented: $showWrongAnswer, actions: {
          Button("Continue") {

          }
      }, message: {
          Text("The correct answer is \(previousWinningMove?.rawValue ?? "Unknown").")
      })
```

## Practice with closures and tuples

I use tuple to see the winning combination in an array.  I then use a where with a closure to to find it and compare it to the winning answer.
