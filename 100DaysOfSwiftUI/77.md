# Day 77 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI - 2022-08-25

Today I finished the first part of the challenge app!  I was able to save json data to the file system. The main strategy was to use class with ObservableObject.

## Observable Object

- ObservableObject Stores the data
- Picture struct uses comparable
- Uses FileManager to save and store json data and uses a custom init to load json data

## Sheets

- Use an enum so that we don't have multiple sheets with the item

```swift
enum ActiveSheet: Identifiable {
    
    case imagePicker, add
    
    var id: Int {
        hashValue
    }
}

.sheet(item: $activeSheet) { item in
    switch item {
    case .add:
        FormPictureView(image: $uiImage, pictureStore: pictureStore)
    case .imagePicker:
        ImagePicker(image: $uiImage, activeSheet: $activeSheet)
    }
}
```

## FormPictureView

- Uses ObservedObject to save the picture
- Uses @Environment(\.dismiss) private var dismiss
- Put into a sheet to make it easy to close and open

## Foreach With ScrollView

- ScrollView allows me to scroll up and down without trying to fix the image
- Uses a NavigationView to direct to a separate view
