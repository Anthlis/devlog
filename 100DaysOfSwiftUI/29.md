# 100DayOfSwiftUI - Day 29 - 2022-05-17

Today I learned about List view in iOS, how to load a text file.

## List View

List Views can have static and dynamic content.  They can also take in a list of item dynamic.  It's important for dynamic content to provide a key so that the iOS render only renders one row when something changes.  You also add sections to a list view to break up the list.

### List Taking in Dynamic Content

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    let people = ["Finn", "Leia", "Luke", "Rey"]
    var body: some View {
        List(people, id: \.self){
            Text("Dynamic row \($0)")            
        }.listStyle(.grouped)
    
    }
}
```

### List Mixing Dynamic and Static Content

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        List(){
            Section("Section 1") {
                Text("Static")
                Text("Static")
            }
            Section("Section 2") {
                ForEach(0..<5) {
                    Text("Hello \($0)")
                }
            }

            Section("Section 3") {
                Text("Static")
            }
            
        }.listStyle(.grouped)
    
    }
}
```

## Loading Text files and other files

You have to be careful about unwrapping stuff.

```swift
 func loadFile() {
        if let fileURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "some-file", withExtension: "txt") {
            if let fileContents = try? String(contentsOf: fileURL) {
                
            }
        }
    }
```
