# Day 27 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI - 2022-05-15

Today I practice with Steppers, DatePickers, and Date Components for getting the parts of a date needed, and machine learning.

## Date Components

This gets today date for 7 AM.

```swift
static var defaultWakeTime: Date {
        var components = DateComponents()
        components.hour = 7
        components.minute = 0
        
        return Calendar.current.date(from: components) ?? Date.now
    }
```

## Machine Learning

This uses CoreML, which is apple's machine learning technology.  You have wrap everything in a do / try.

```swift
    func calculateBedtime() {
        do {
            let config = MLModelConfiguration()
            let model = try SleepCalculator(configuration: config)
            
            let components = Calendar.current.dateComponents([.hour, .minute], from: wakeUp)
            let hour = (components.hour ?? 0) * 60 * 60
            let minutes = (components.minute ?? 0) * 60
            
            let predicton = try model.prediction(wake: Double(hour + minutes), estimatedSleep: sleepAmount, coffee: Double(coffeeAmount))
            
            let sleepTime = wakeUp - predicton.actualSleep
            alertTitle = "Your ideal bedtime is ..."
            alertMessage = sleepTime.formatted(date: .omitted, time: .shortened)
            
        } catch  {
            alertTitle = "Error"
            alertMessage = "Sorry there was a problem calculating your bed time"
        }
        
        showAlert = true
    }
```
