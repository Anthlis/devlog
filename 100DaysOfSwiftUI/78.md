# Day 78 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI - 2022-08-26

Today I got to practice getting the user's location and adding it to the map.  The big thing I realized was that the previously saved data was no longer able to work with the new data that required lat lng.  I got around to this by deleting the app, but it highlights a data migration problem.

## Code 

https://github.com/phptuts/100DaysOfSwiftUI/blob/main/RememberMe/RememberMe/LocationFetcher.swift
https://github.com/phptuts/100DaysOfSwiftUI/blob/main/RememberMe/RememberMe/PictureStore.swift
https://github.com/phptuts/100DaysOfSwiftUI/blob/main/RememberMe/RememberMe/PictureView.swift

## Adding the Pin to the Map

```swift
Map(coordinateRegion: .constant(picture.region), annotationItems: [picture]) { pic in
                MapPin(coordinate: pic.region.center)
            }
```

## Person's computed property for the region

```swift
 var region: MKCoordinateRegion {
        MKCoordinateRegion(center: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: latitude, longitude: longitude), span: MKCoordinateSpan(latitudeDelta: 0.003, longitudeDelta: 0.003))
    }
```

## I start asking for the user's location in the PictureStore so it only happens once

```swift
let locationFetcher = LocationFetcher()
    init() {
        locationFetcher.start()
        if let pics: [Picture] =  try? FileManager.read(fileName: "people.json") {
            pictures = pics
        }
    }
```
