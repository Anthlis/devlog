# Day 11 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI - 2022-04-25

Today I learned how to create private properties and private(set) properties on structs.  I also learned how to create static properties and functions on structs and when to use them.

## private or private(set)

private means that property can not be access by an object directly
private(set) means that property can be read by an object but not changed.

```swift 

struct Dog {
    let color: String
    private(set) var speed: Int = 5
    private var id: String = "3234234"
    
    init(color: String) {
        self.color = color
    }
}

var poodle = Dog(color: "White")

poodle.id // this will fail because id is marked private
poodle.speed // this is allowed because private sets allows you to read the variable
poodle.speed = 5 // this will fail because private set does not allow you to set the variable.

```

## Static

Static properties and methods allow you to store static data on the type itself.   This why to refer to type when accessing the static property.

```swift
struct AppData {
    static let version = "1.3 beta 2"
    static let saveFilename = "settings.json"
    static let homeURL = "https://www.hackingwithswift.com"
}

AppData.version // Notice it use AppVersion or the type of data to get to the property.

struct Employee {
    let username: String
    let password: String
    
    static let example = Employee(username: "cfederighi", password: "secret")
}
```
