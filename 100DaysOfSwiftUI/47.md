# Day 47 - 100DaysOfSwiftUI

Today was milestone project day.  I had to build a habit-tracking app from scratch.  The biggest things I got to practice with were @Binding / passing a struct object into a view, using a geometry reader to draw a bottom border, and JSON encoding and decoding.

## @Binding 

When you need to pass a struct that will be edited by a child view use @Binding and it will pass the struct as if by reference.

EditHabitForm

```swift
struct HabitRow: View {
    
    @ObservedObject var habitList: HabitStore
    
    @Binding var habit: Habit

```

ContentView.swift

```swift
List {
    ForEach(habitList.habits) { h in
        let index = habitList.habits.firstIndex(where: { $0.id == h.id}) ?? 0

        HabitRow(habitList: habitList, habit: $habitList.habits[index])
    }.onDelete(perform: delete)
}
```

## Geometry 

Here I used Geometry reader to draw rectangle as bottom border but at the right size.

HabitRow

```swift
GeometryReader { geo in
                Rectangle()
                    .frame(width: geo.size.width, height: 2)
                    .background(.black)
            }
```

## JSON Encode and Decode

JSON ENCODE

```swift
func save() {
        let encoder = JSONEncoder()
        
        if let habitString = try? encoder.encode(habits) {
            UserDefaults.standard.set(habitString, forKey: "habits")
        }
        print("SAVED CALLED")
    }
```

JSON DECODE

```swift
init() {
        let decoder = JSONDecoder()
        let defaults = UserDefaults.standard
        if let jsonString = defaults.data(forKey: "habits") {
            if let newHabits = try? decoder.decode([Habit].self, from: jsonString) {
                habits = newHabits
            }
        }
    }

```
