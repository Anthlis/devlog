## Day 37 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI

Today I got practice create classes and structs to store data in a list.  


## Storing Data in the list

- @Published tells swift if that property of the class update update the UI.
- We have to use ForEach because we want to delete stuff in our list
- The name approach is not great because it's not unique

```swift
struct ExpenseItem {
    var name: String
    var type: String
    var amount: Double
}

class Expenses: ObservableObject {
    @Published var items = [ExpenseItem]()
}


struct ContentView: View {
    
    @StateObject var expenses = Expenses()
        
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List {
                ForEach(expenses.items, id: \.name) { item in
                    Text(item.name)
                }.onDelete(perform: removeItems)
            }.navigationTitle("IExpense")
                .toolbar {
                    Button {
                        let expsense = ExpenseItem(name: "Test", type: "Personal", amount: 5)
                        expenses.items.append(expsense)

                    } label: {
                        Image(systemName: "plus")
                    }
                }
        }
    }
    
    func removeItems(at offsets: IndexSet) {
        expenses.items.remove(atOffsets: offsets)
    }
    
}
```

## Identifiable Protocol

- Must have and id that that is a UUID
- Allows us to get rid of id in the ForEach
- Solves our lack of uniqueness problem with the name

```swift
struct ExpenseItem: Identifiable {
    var name: String
    var type: String
    var amount: Double
    var id = UUID()
    
}
```

```swift
ForEach(expenses.items) { item in
    Text(item.name)
}.onDelete(perform: removeItems)
```
