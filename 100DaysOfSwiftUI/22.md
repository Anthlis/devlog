# Day 22 - 100DaysOfSwiftUI - 2022-05-09

Today was challenge day.  I got practice creating @State variables that controlled alerts and score.  I also created the reset game logic as well.

## Code

## How it works

1\. flagTapped is called this determines if the correct flag is choosen.  It sets showingScore to true.  This function also increase or decreases the score.

2\. Setting showing score true will trigger the first alert to show.

3\. In the alert closure depending on scoreTitle we show either score if it's correct or wrong answer with the name of the flag.

4\. After continue button is pressed askQuestion function is called

5\. Question increase questionNumber by one if it's less than 8 otherwise it sets showEndGameAlert to true

6\. showEndGameAlert triggers another alert that will reset the score and the questionNumber variable to zero.

```swift
    @State var countries = ["Estonia", "France", "Germany", "Ireland", "Italy", "Nigeria", "Russia", "Spain", "UK", "US"].shuffled()
    
    @State var correctAnswer = Int.random(in: 0...2)
    
    @State private var showingScore = false
    @State private var scoreTitle = ""
    @State private var selectedAnswer = 0
    @State private var questionNumber = 1;
    @State private var showEndGameAlert = false
    
    @State private var score = 0

//...
        .alert(scoreTitle, isPresented: $showingScore) {
            Button("Continue", action: askQuestion)
        } message: {
            if scoreTitle == "Correct" {
                Text("Your score is \(score)")
            } else {
                Text("Wrong! That's the flag of \(countries[selectedAnswer])")
            }
            
        }.alert("Game Over", isPresented: $showEndGameAlert) {
            Button("Continue") {
                questionNumber = 0
                score = 0
            }
        } message: {
            Text("You're total score was \(score)")
        }
        
    }
    
    func flagTapped(_ number: Int) {
        selectedAnswer = number
        if number == correctAnswer {
            scoreTitle = "Correct"
            score += 1
        } else {
            scoreTitle = "Wrong"
            score -= 1
        }
        
        showingScore = true
    }
    
    func askQuestion() {
        
        if (questionNumber < 8) {
            questionNumber += 1;
        } else {
           showEndGameAlert = true
        }
        
        
        countries.shuffle()
        correctAnswer = Int.random(in: 0...2)
    }

```
