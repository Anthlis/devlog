# Day 26 - 100DaysOfSwiftUI - 2022-05-14

Today I learned about Steppers, DatePickers, Dates, and machine learning.  It's crazy how easy it is to do machine learning in apps. You don't have to understand the math or science behind it to use it!

## Stepper

Stepper allow to control a Double or Int with a plus or minus button.  You can control valid values and the amount it steps up or down.

```swift
        Stepper("\(sleepAmount.formatted()) hours", value: $sleepAmount, in: 4...12, step: 0.25)

```


## Date Picker

This allows you to control date ranges displayed, time displayed, ect.  Lots of options

```swift
    @State private var wakeUp = Date.now
    
    var body: some View {
        DatePicker("Please enter a date", selection: $wakeUp, in: Date.now...)
            .labelsHidden()
        
    }

```

## Date

Always use the apple library and whenever possible use apples formatting for dates that are built into the Text field

```swift
        Text(Date.now, format: .dateTime.day().month().year())
```
