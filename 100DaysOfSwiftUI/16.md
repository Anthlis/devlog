# Day 16 of 100DaysOfSwift

Today I was an intro to Swift UI.  

- I learned how to bind a property of an object to the user interface.
- I learned how to do two-way binding in Swift, where a text field can dynamically change a variable
- I learned how to loop through an array and dynamically create views

## Code

It got reset so no code :)

## How to bind a struct property to a view text

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    
    @State private var count = 0
    
    var body: some View {
        Button("Count: \(count)") {
            count += 1
        }
    }
}
```

## How to do two way binding in Swift

$name in the TextField is two way binding.  Meaning that if data in the text field changes it changes the value in the variable.   We don't have do it with Text.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    
    @State private var name = ""
    
    var body: some View {
        Form {
            TextField("Hello", text: $name)
            Text("Nice to meet you, \(name)")
        }
    }
}
```

## Rending stuff in a loop

Use ForEach View to loop through stuff in an array.  This will spit out 3 text views.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    
    @State private var names = ["John", "Joe", "Cam"]
    
    var body: some View {
        Form {
            ForEach(names, id: \.self) {
                Text("Hello, \($0)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```
