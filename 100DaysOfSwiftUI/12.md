# Day 12 of #100DaysofSwiftUI - 2022-04-25

Today I learned how to create classes, how to use inheritance,  how objects of classes point to data,  how to override functions and initializers, and how to use deenit.

## How to create classes

A class a way of creating a type in Swift.  It allows you borrow properties and functions from other classes.  

```swift
class User {
  let name: String
  init(name: String) {
     self.name = name
  }
}
```

## How to use inheritance

This is an example where Developer inheritants from Employee.  This means that the developer objects will have an hours property and a printSummary method.

```swift
class Employee {
    let hours: Int
    
    init(hours: Int) {
        self.hours = hours
    }
    
    func printSummary() {
        print("I work \(hours) a day.")
    }
}

// final means that Developer can not have child classes
final class Developer: Employee {
    func work() {
        print("I'm writing for \(hours) hours.")
    }
}
```

## How objects of classes point to data

Variables that store class data store pointer to the data.  In this example it means that user1 and user2 variables are pointing to the same data.  user3 is not because it creates a copy

```swift
class User {
    var username = "Anonymous"
    
    func copy() -> User {
        let user = User()
        user.username = self.username
        return user
    }
}

var user1 = User()
var user3 = user1.copy()
var user2 = user1
user1.username = "Taylor"
print(user1.username) // print Talyor
print(user2.username) // print Talyor
print(user3.username) // print Anonymous

```

## Using initializer

Initializer in structs are almost like the ones in classes.  The difference is that if you have a child class with a custom initailizer it must call super.init or the parent class initializer.

```swift
class Game {
    var score = 0 {
        didSet {
            print("Score is now \(score)")
        }
    }
    
    let name: String
    
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

class Basketball: Game {
    let maxTime: Int
    
    init(maxTime: Int) {
        self.maxTime = maxTime
        super.init(name: "Basketball")
    }
}

```

## Deinit 

Deinit is called when all the points to object in memory are no longer needed.  It's a closure that does not take any parameters.

```swift
class User {
    let id: Int
    
    init(id: Int) {
        self.id = id
        print("User \(id): I am alive")
    }
    
    deinit {
        print("Usre \(id): I am dead")
    }
}

```
