# Day 4 of 100DaysofSwiftUI - 2022-04-17

Today I learned about type annonations and a clever way to use sets to get the unique count in an array.

## Type Annotations

Type annotations allow the us to tell Swift the exact type of data we want the variable or constant to store.

```swift
var greeting = "Hello, playground"

let surname: String = "Lasso"

let score: Double = 0

let luckyNumber: Int = 13

let isAuthenticated: Bool = true

let albums: [String] = ["Red", "Fearless"]

let user: [String: String] = ["id": "user_id"]

let books: Set<String> = Set([
    "red",
    "blue"
])
```
