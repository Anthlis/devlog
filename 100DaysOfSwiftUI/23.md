# Day 23 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI - 2022-05-10

Today I learned:
- Why Swift UI uses structs over classes
- The frame property is used to control the size of an element
- Modifiers are applied one after the other. (not really but it's a mental short cut)
- Why some View
- Conditional Modifiers
- Storing Views in properties
- You can create your own custom view or components


# Why Swift UI uses structs over classes

- Avoid insane inheritance trees 
- You only store what you need
- It's easy to see what's going 


# The frame property is used to control the size of an element

```swift
        Button("Hello World") {
            print(type(of: self.body))
        }
        .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
```

## Modifiers are applied one after the other. (not really but it's a mental short cut)

So they are not rendered that way but they applied to a view that way.

```swift
        Text("Hello, world!")
            .padding()
            .background(.red)
            .padding()
            .background(.blue)
            .padding()
            .background(.green)
            .padding()
            .background(.yellow)

```

## Why some View

- View has a hole in the type meaning that you can't really say what it is based on the interface View.  
- Types in Swift UI are really long and almost impossible to type out so it's much better to write some view and let the compiler figure it out.

# Conditional Modifiers

They allow you to change the state of the user interface without rendering the page.  This example will change the button text from red to blue and back based on the useRedText property.

```swift

struct ContentView: View {
    
    @State private var useRedText = false
    
    var body: some View {
        Button("Hello world") {
            useRedText.toggle()
        }.foregroundStyle(useRedText ? .red : .blue)
    }
}
```

## Environment Modifiers

Allow you change all the child views at once with a single modifier.  The child modifier will sometimes over ride the parent modifiers.

```swift
 var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("test")
            Text("MOo")
                .font(.largeTitle)
            Text("lol")
            Text("ewes")
        }.font(.title)
    }
```

## You can store views in properties

Becare if you using this too much in a view it could be a sign the view got too big.

```swift
     var  motto1: some View { Text("Draco dormiens")
    }
    
    let motto2 = Text("nunquam titillandus")
    
    @ViewBuilder var spells: some View {
            Text("Lumos")
            Text("Obliviate")
        }

    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            motto1.foregroundColor(.red)
            motto2.foregroundColor(.blue)
            spells
        }
    }
```

## You can create your own custom view or components

```swift
struct CapsuleText: View {
    
    @State var text: String
    
    var body: some View {
        Text(text)
            .font(.largeTitle)
            .padding()
            .foregroundColor(.white)
            .background(.blue)
            .clipShape(Capsule())

    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 10) {
            CapsuleText(text: "First")
                .foregroundColor(.white)
            CapsuleText(text: "Second")
                .foregroundColor(.red)
        }
    }
}
```
