# Day 76 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI - 2022-08-19

Today was an excellent challenge day. I learned a ton more about voice-over and how smart it is. It's so damn smart that it can analyze and read the pictures in the moonshot app. I tried to do a full audit of the moonshot app and made it better. 


## CupCake Corner Challenge

That one was easy all I had to do was put this code on the Image and ProgressView to get it o not read.

```swift
   .accessibilityElement(children: .ignore)
```

## iExpense

I learned ton about reading money to the app.  I you specify the users currency and format it properly it will say something like this for $3.22.  Three Dollars and 22 cents.  


```swift
        .accessibilityElement(children: .ignore)
        .accessibilityLabel("Spent \(NumberFormatter.localizedString(from: item.amount as NSNumber, number: .currency))) on \(item.name).  Classified as \(item.type).")
```

## Moonshot

For the grid button I changed it to describe what it actually does instead of just saying grid or list.

```
.accessibilityLabel("Change to \(isGrid ? "List View" : "Grid View")")
```

For images of landing I disable voice over for the image and read a sentence describing the image.  Thankfully I tested it out on N\A which did not make sense to me verbally.  So I replace it with unknown data.

```swift
    .accessibilityElement(children: .ignore)
    .accessibilityLabel("Mission \(mission.displayName) launched on \(mission.formattedLaunchDate == "N/A" ? "Unknown Date" :  mission.formattedLaunchDate)")
```

On the mission page I replace the image with mission display name logo

```swift
                        .accessibilityLabel("\(mission.displayName) logo")
```
