# 100DaysOfSwiftUI - Day 10 - 2022-04-24

Today I learned how to create structs, how to create functions in structs that change the struct, how to create property observers, how to create custom initializer and how to create virtual properties.

## How to create structs

Structs is a way to create a custom type in Swift.  They can have functions and can store values.

```swift
struct Album {
    let title: String
    let artist: String
    let year: Int
    
    func printSummary() {
        print("\(title) (\(year) by \(artist))")
    }
}

let red = Album(title: "Red", artist: "Taylor Swift", year: 2012)
let wings = Album(title: "Wings", artist: "BTS", year: 2016)
print(red.title)
red.printSummary()

print(wings.title)
wings.printSummary()
```

## functions that mutate struct

If your function mutates a struct you have to mark it as a mutating functions.  This way constants of that struct's type won't be able to call it.

```swift
struct Employee {
    let name: String
    var vacationRemaining = 14
    
    mutating func takeVacation(days: Int) {
        if vacationRemaining > days {
            vacationRemaining -= days
            print("I'm going on vacation")
            print("Days remaining: \(vacationRemaining)")
        } else {
            print("Oops! There are aren't enough days remaining.")
        }
    }
}
```

## how to create property observers

Property observers are closures that run when a property changes on your struct.  A property is a variable inside your struct.

```swift
struct Game {
    var score = 0 {
        didSet {
            print("Score did change: \(score)")
        }
    }
}
```


## Custom Initializers

Custom initiialize delete the built in initializer.  The only rule is that all properties in the struct must be given a value.

```swift
struct Player {
    let name: String
    let number: Int
    
    init(name: String) {
        self.number = Int.random(in: 1...99)
        self.name = name
    }
}

let player = Player(name: "Megan")
print(player.number)
```

## Computed variables

These are variables that are dynamically calculated in swift code rather than being stored.

```swift 
struct Employee2 {
    let name: String
    var vacationAllocated = 14
    var vacationTaken = 0
    
    var vactionRemaining: Int {
        get {
            vacationAllocated - vacationTaken
        }
        
        set {
            vacationAllocated = vacationTaken + newValue
        }
    }
}


var archer2 = Employee2(name: "Archer Sterling")

archer2.vacationTaken += 4
print(archer2.vactionRemaining)
archer2.vacationTaken += 4
print(archer2.vactionRemaining)
archer2.vactionRemaining = 5
print(archer2.vacationAllocated)
```
