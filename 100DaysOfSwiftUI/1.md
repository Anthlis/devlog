let score = 10
let lowerScore = score - 2
let higherScore = score + 10
let doubleScore = score * 2
let halfScore /= 2
```

## Double Error

Because it stores decimal number in binary there's a small rounding error with double math.

```
let weirdNum = 0.2 + 0.1
// This actually equals 0.30000000000000004
```
