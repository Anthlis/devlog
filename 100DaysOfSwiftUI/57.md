# Day 57 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI - 2022-07-17

I learned how to put constraints on core data entities, how Hashable works and why it's important, and why you should use computed properties for your data models with core data.

## Hashable

- It takes in data and produces a String
- If some object is Hashable it means that you can use it as self in a ForEach loop
- Hashable is guaranteed to generate the same value per application run only.

## Computed Property Wrapper

Core data is super old so in the background it's storing everything in a dictionary.  The side effect is that you can not enforce nullable values at the object level.  To get around this nullable problem use a computed variable for reading the values.

```swift
extension Movie {

    @nonobjc public class func fetchRequest() -> NSFetchRequest<Movie> {
        return NSFetchRequest<Movie>(entityName: "Movie")
    }

    @NSManaged public var title: String?
    @NSManaged public var directory: String?
    @NSManaged public var year: Int16
    
    public var wrappedTitle: String {
        title ?? "Unknown Title"
    }
}
```
