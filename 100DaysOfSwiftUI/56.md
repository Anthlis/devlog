I got practice creating my text view with @Binding and adding a column/property in core data.

## Custom Text Field

I have two binding one for isValid and one for the text.  If the text is not valid which is controlled by the parent view then I display a red rectangle at the bottom of text view.  Does not look great but it was a good learning experience.

```swift
struct CustomTextField: View {
    
    @Binding var text: String 
    
    @Binding var isValid: Bool
    
    let fieldName: String
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextField(fieldName, text: $text)
            if !isValid {
                GeometryReader { geo in
                    Rectangle()
                        .foregroundColor(.red)
                        .frame(width: geo.size.width, height: 2)
                        
                }
            }
            
        }
    }
}
```



## Created Field

I add a date field to the book entity and then was used with null collasing.

```swift
var dateReviewd: String {
     book.created?.formatted(date: .abbreviated, time: .omitted) ?? "Unknown Date"
}

Text("Date Review: \(dateReviewd)")
    .padding()
```
