# Day 50 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI

I got practice with ObservedObjects and passing them into a over views

## ObservedObjects

Where the object is created you use @StateObject

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    
    @StateObject var order = Order()

   // ...
}
```

Use @ObservedObject for views that share the object

```swift
struct AddressView: View {
    @ObservedObject var order: Order
}
```

The class is marked @Published for the properties that are in the class that need to be notified for the UI.

```swift
class Order: ObservableObject {
    static let types = ["Vanilla", "Strawberry", "Chocalate", "Rainbow"]
    
    @Published var type = 0
    @Published var quantity = 3
    @Published var specialRequestEnabled = false {
        didSet {
            if !specialRequestEnabled {
                extraFrosting = false
                addSprinkles = false
            }
        }
    }
    @Published var extraFrosting = false
    @Published var addSprinkles = false
}

```
