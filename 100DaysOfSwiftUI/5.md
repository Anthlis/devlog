# Day 5 of #100DaysofSwiftUI - 2022-04-18

Today I learned about if, else if, switch statements, and ternary operators in Swift.  I also learned howSwift work with enums in switch statements.

## Code

## If and else if and else

- if is used to execute code if something is true.  
- else if used to add an extra condition that will execute if the previous if or else if is false but the new condition is true.
- else will execute if none of the conditions are true.

```swift
enum TransportOption {
    case airplace, helicopter, bicycle, car, escooter
}

let transport = TransportOption.airplace

if transport == .airplace || transport == .helicopter {
    print("Let's fly")
} else if transport == .bicycle {
    print("Hope there is a bike path")
} else if transport == .car {
    print("Time to get stuck in traffic")
} else {
    print("I am going to hir a scooter now!")
}

```

## Switch

Switch is used to for creating code that will handle all conditions.  It does this by allowing you specify a default case if none of your test case work.  They are used in enums a lot because you have write something for each case.

```swift
enum Forecast {
    case sun, rain, wind, snow, unknown
}

let forecast = Forecast.rain

switch forecast {
case .sun:
    print("It shoudl be a nice day")
case .rain:
    print("Pack an umbrella.")
case .wind :
    print("Wear something warm")
case .snow:
    print("School is cancelled")
case .unknown:
    print("Our forecast is broken")
}
```


## Ternary Operators

These are used to choose between two values depending on if something is true.  What ? True : False.

```swift
let names = ["Jayne", "Kaylee", "Mal"]
let crewCount = names.isEmpty ? "No One" : "\(names.count) people"
print(crewCount)
```
