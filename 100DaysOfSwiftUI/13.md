# Day 13 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI - 2022-04-30

Today I learned about protocols, extensions, some keyword, and protocol extensions.

## Protocol

A protocol or interface is a way of getting your classes or struct to conform to a pattern.  A struct or class can implement as many protocols as you want.

```swift
protocol Vehicle {
    var name: String { get }
    var currentPassenger: Int { get set }
    func estimatedTime(for distance: Int) -> Int
    func travel(distance: Int)
}

struct Car: Vehicle {
    
    var currentPassenger = 1
    
    let name = "Car"
    
    func estimatedTime(for distance: Int) -> Int {
        distance / 50
    }
    
    func travel(distance: Int) {
        print("I'm driving \(distance)km")
    }
    
    func openSunroof() {
        print("It's a nice day")
    }
}

protocol CanBeElectric {
    
}

struct Bicycle: Vehicle, CanBeElectric {
    
    let name = "bike"
    
    var currentPassenger = 1
    
    func estimatedTime(for distance: Int) -> Int {
        distance / 10
    }
    
    func travel(distance: Int) {
        print("I am cycling \(distance)km.")
    }
}
```


## Extensions

Extension allow you dynamically add functions and properties to a class or a struct.

```swift
extension String {
    func trimmed() -> String {
        return self.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
    }
    mutating func trim() {
        self = self.trimmed()
    }
    
    var lines: [String] {
        self.components(separatedBy: .newlines)
    }
}

var quote = "  The truth is rarely pure and never simple"

let trimmed = quote.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
let trimmed2 = quote.trimmed()

let lyrics = """
But I keep crusing
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got thsi music
"""
lyrics.lines.count
```

## Some Keyword

Allows you to return a type that implements a protocol that refers to itself.  What this means is that the object that will be returns will implement the protocol but the compiler has no way of know what that object is under the hood.  This is used a lot in Swift UI.


```swift
func randomThing() -> some Equatable {
    return 4
}

func randomThing2() -> some Equatable {
    return 90
}

/**
This will blow up with this error. 

Cannot convert value of type 'some Equatable' (result of 'randomThing2()') to 
expected argument type 'some Equatable' (result of 'randomThing()')
*/
if randomThing() == randomThing2() {
    print("Won't work")
}

```

## Protocol Extension

These allow you to add functionality directly the interface.  You can override it in the struct or class that implements the protocol.

```swift
protocol Person {
    var name: String { get}
    func sayHello()
}

extension Person {
    func sayHello() {
        print("Hi, I am \(name)")
    }
}



struct Employee: Person {
    
    let name: String
}

let taylor = Employee(name: "Rob")
taylor.sayHello()
```
