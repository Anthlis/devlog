# Day 21 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI - 2022-05-08

Today I learned how to apply all stuff I learned yesterday.  I also learned how to create a clipped image effect, which was new.  We also got to see how to apply a cool gradient to the app.  Also noticed how you can have ZStack -> VStack -> VStack.

## Clipped Images

The .clipShape(Capsule()) is what gives it's shape.

```swift
ForEach(0..<3) { number in
    Button {
        flagTapped(number)
    } label: {
    // Clipped Image code
        Image(countries[number])
            .renderingMode(.original)
            .clipShape(Capsule())
            .shadow(radius: 5)
    }
}
```

## Cool Radial Gradient

ignoreSafeArea is what makes it take up whole space of the phone.

```swift
     RadialGradient(stops: [
          .init(color: Color(red: 0.1, green: 0.2, blue: 0.45 ), location: 0.3), 
          .init(color: Color(red: 0.76, green: 0.15, blue: 0.26), location: 0.3)
     ], center: .top, startRadius: 200, endRadius:   700).ignoresSafeArea()
```

## Text Modifiers

Lots of ways to modify the text, making it bigger or and changing the color to white.

```swift
                Text("Guess the Flag")
                    .font(.largeTitle.bold())
                    .foregroundColor(.white)

```
