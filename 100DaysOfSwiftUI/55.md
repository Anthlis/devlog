## Delete Data

Just like regular delete but with save.

```swift
ForEach(books) { book in
///....                   
}
.onDelete(perform: deleteBooks)


func deleteBooks(at offsets: IndexSet) {
    for offset in offsets {
        let book = books[offset]
        moc.delete(book)
    }
    try? moc.save()
}
```

## Sorting Data

```swift
  @FetchRequest(sortDescriptors: [
      SortDescriptor(\.title),
      SortDescriptor(\.author)
  ]) var books: FetchedResults<Book>

```

## Learned how to manually go back

Then call dismiss where you want to go back.

```swift
@Environment(\.dismiss) var dismiss
```
