# Day 39 of 100DaysofSwiftUI - 2022-06-04

Today I learned about images and GeometryReader


## Image

- You make fit a certain space my making it resizable()
- To make it scale in portion use scaleToFit which will make sure that it fits in the frame or scaleToFill which make take up more than the frame size.

```swift
        Image("example")
            .resizable()
            .scaledToFit()

```

## GeometryReader

This is give you the an object that can give you the size of the geometry of the screen.  It allows you to save I want the image to take up 80% of the screen.  If you want it to be centered create a another frame below the first frame that takes up 100% of the width.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        GeometryReader { geo in
        Image("example")
            .resizable()
            .scaledToFit()
            .frame(width: geo.size.width * 0.8)
            .frame(width: geo.size.width, height: geo.size.height)
        }
    }
}
```
