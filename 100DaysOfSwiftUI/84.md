## Save JSON Data to UserDefaults

- All actions should happen in the store.  For example the save function should never be called outside of the class.
- Codable does all the work for us
- Use Constant / let when you need to repeat a string in your class
- Protect the class from writing data to it using private(set) which allows reading but not writing data.

## Save photos to qr code

- Add key to target -> info `Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description`
- Use a cached image state variable so that we do not have recreate the qr code and it centralizes all the logic around the qr code
- onAppear to create the qr when the view loads
- onChange to recreate the qr when name or email address changes

## Notification

- Biggy backing of the swipe gesture
- Create conent which is what the notification is
- Then trigger which control the user sees the notification
- Then you create the request and user UNNotificationCenter to send the request
- You have to check to see if the user gave you permission
