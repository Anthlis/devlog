# Day 73 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI - 2022-08-16

Today I learned got practice creating a ViewModel with @MainActor on it. I did not do that the first time, which was not good. The reason is that updates do not happen on the main thread without that annotation. I also created some state changes that fire when authentication fails.

## State changes when auth fails

- Notice it has to wrapped in MainActor because it's not executing on the main thread.

```swift
context.evaluatePolicy(.deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics, localizedReason: reason, reply: { success, authenticateError  in
    if success {
        Task { @MainActor in
            self.isUnlocked = true
        }
    } else {
        Task { @MainActor in
            self.error = "Authentication failed"
            self.showError = true
        }
    }
})
```

## EditView Model

- Has Main Actor Attribute
- It's created in the init meaning that it has to be wrapped in StateObject.  The reason we have to do it this way is that ViewModel is dependant on the location.

```swift
 init(location: Location, onSave: @escaping (Location) -> Void) {
        self.onSave = onSave
        self._viewModel = StateObject(wrappedValue: ViewModel(location: location))
    }
```

Other than it's pretty standard.
