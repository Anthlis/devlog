Today I learned about the toggle function on boolean values, and string interpolation.

## How to create boolean variables and constants

```swift
let isGreen = true
var isBlue = false
```

## How to use toggle function on variables

```swift
let isGreen = true
isGreen.toggle() // now isGreen stores false
```

## How use string interpolation

```swift
let age = 36
let name = "Noah G"
let message = "Hi, my name \(name) and I am \(age) and \(age * 7) in dog years"
// prints -> Hi, my name Noah G and I am 36 and 252 in dog years
```

## Checkpoint 1

Create a constant that stores a temp in Celcius and use that to create another constant that stores temp in Fahrenheit.  Then print it out nice with both constant in a string.

```swift
// Checkpoint 1
let celcius = 23.0
let fahrenheit = celcius * (9 / 5) + 32

print("Celcius = \(celcius) and Fahrenheit = \(fahrenheit)")
// prints Celcius = 23.0 and Fahrenheit = 73.4
```
