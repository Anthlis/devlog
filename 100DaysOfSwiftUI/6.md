# Day 6 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI - 2022-04-19

Today I learned for loop, ranges, foreach loops, while loops, break, continue and did the classic fizzbuzz coding challenge in Swift.

## Code

## For loop

This is how you loop over something a fix amount of times.

```swift
for i in 1...12 {
    print("5 x \(i) = \(5 * i)")
}
```

## Foreach Loop 

This is how you loop over the elements in an array.

```swift
let platforms = ["iOS", "macOS", "tvOS", "watchOS"]

for os in platforms {
    print("Swift works great on \(os).")
}
```

## while loop

While loops allow you to loop over something until it's false

```swift
var countdown = 10

while countdown > 0 {
    print("\(countdown)")
    countdown -= 1
}
```

## Continue

Continue will skip over an item in the loop.

```swift
for file in filenames {
    if !file.hasSuffix(file) {
        continue
    }
    
    print("Found picture \(file)")
}

```


## Break

Break stops the execution of a loop.

```swift
var number1 = 4
var number2 = 14
var multiples = [Int]()

for i in 1...100_000 {
    if i.isMultiple(of: number1) && i.isMultiple(of: number2) {
        multiples.append(i)
        if multiples.count == 10 {
            break
        }
    }
}

print(multiples)
```
